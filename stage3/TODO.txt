1. Down sampling
   A -> A'
   B -> B'
2. Define notion of match
3. Use library for matching
   A' -> blocking
                  \
                   C pairs
   B' -> blocking /

Here we need to decide what blockers to use. 
If it is learn-based blocker, we need to define a set of features
4. From C of matching pair, get a sample S.
5. Manually label S (match / not match)
6. Using labelled-S, develop the train set and test set, similar to what we did in P2
   We basically test here what kinds of matchers has the best precision and recall
7. Depends on what we get, we might revisit step 3->6. The outcome is that we should
   be able to determine:
   - blockers to be used in step 3
   - matchers to be used in step 6
Then we run the entire pipeline with input table A, B
