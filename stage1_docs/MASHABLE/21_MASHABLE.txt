Valentine's Day is a great day to revel in a relationship, but a better day to embrace the existential dread or spiral into doubt about whether love even exists! Netflix and Black Mirror have you covered there with the actual invention of Coach, the Season 4 dating app that tells people exactly how long their relationships will last.
In "Hang the D.J.," Amy (Georgina Campbell) and Frank (Joe Cole) use Coach and are among a society full of people who put blind faith in "the system" to match people with their soulmates. At first, Frank and Amy get 12 hours together, but a second chance proves to be longer and more complicated due to how they approach the System and its power over when relationships end.

So, if you're ready to take this perilous plunge, let's get started on the Coach website.

So far, so good. Now tap anywhere, as prompted, and you'll be given another chance to click through. This version of Coach isn't going to find your soulmate, but it will tell you how much time is left with your current partner. Fun!!

After that, you get a URL you can share with your partner, or in my case, close friend and roommate (she has not seen this episode).

Your turn again! If you're impatient, like this reporter, you'll already have plugged your custom URL back into the browser and been chided by Coach for opening the app in too many tabs. I get it, Coach, timing is everything! How about now?

Okay, Coach, we're ready! Tell us how long this relationship will last!


Well this was terrifying, and that too with no romantic stakes. But go on, if you're feeling cheeky this Valentine's Day, test Coach out with a partner and see what The System has in store! It's just one of many ways to get into a fight on this most romantic of holidays.
Black Mirror is streaming on Netflix.
