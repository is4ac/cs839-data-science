Missed out on your chance to see Get Out last year? Or just want to see it again? Either way, you'll have a shot to do just that this month.
On Feb. 19, Presidents' Day, Get Out will screen for free at 55 AMC Theatre locations. You'll want to line up early, as each location will host only one 7:00 p.m. screening and tickets will be distributed on a first-come, first-served basis on that day.

You'll need a photo I.D. handy in order to get a ticket, and the offer is limited to one per customer. So if you're planning to see your local Get Out screening in a group, everyone will need to request a ticket individually at the participating AMC location of your choice.
The screenings will be held across the country in major cities. It's a long list; you can find out if a theater near you will be hosting a free Get Out screening right here.
"When [director Jordan Peele] approached us about a way to thank fans one year after the release of Get Out, we thought a Presidents’ Day screening during Black History Month would be a wonderful way to commemorate the film’s impact," Universal Pictures exec Jim Orr said in a prepared statement. 
"The success of his stunning vision would not have been possible without the audience’s passion for both Get Out’s groundbreaking storytelling and its deft use of art as society’s mirror."
Peele also shared a thank you of his own in a tweet.
