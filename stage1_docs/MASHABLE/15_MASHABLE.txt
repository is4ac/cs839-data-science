Actor Jeffrey Tambor has officially been fired from Amazon's Transparent over claims of sexual harassment, according to The Hollywood Reporter. Amazon investigated the harassment claims of Tambor's former assistant Van Barnes and costar Trace Lysette.Â

Tambor denied Barnes' allegations when they first surfaced in November, adding that he didn't see how he could return to Transparent in the current "politicized atmosphere." In his statement, he expressed "deep regret if any action of mine was ever misinterpreted by anyone as being aggressive" and added "the idea that I would deliberately harass anyone is simply and utterly untrue."
Amazon is under particular scrutiny in the fight against sexual assault and harassment after the resignation of former studio head Roy Price and other high-profile executives. The high-level shakeup came roughly a month before accusations against Tambor and right in the throes of breaking news about Harvey Weinstein.
A fifth season of Transparent is in the works and due later this year. Show runner Jill Soloway told THR:
I have great respect and admiration for Van Barnes and Trace Lysette, whose courage in speaking out about their experience on Transparent is an example of the leadership this moment in our culture requires. We are grateful to the many trans people who have supported our vision for Transparent since its inception and remain heartbroken about the pain and mistrust their experience has generated in our community. We are taking definitive action to ensure our workplace respects the safety and dignity of every individual, and are taking steps to heal as a family.
Mashable reached out to both Amazon and Tambor's manager for comment.
