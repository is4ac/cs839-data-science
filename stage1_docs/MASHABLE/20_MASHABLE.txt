If you want to make it in the entertainment industry, you gotta give the people what they want. And the people want naked zombies. [Editor's Note: Do they?]
The Walking Dead will feature its first fully nude zombie at some point before the end of Season 8, executive producer and director Greg Nicotera told Entertainment Weekly Wednesday. So if you're into that sort of thing, this may be a good jumping-on point for you.

"There’s an episode where we did our first fully nude walker," Nicotera told EW, referencing the rest of Season 8. "We’ve never done that before."
Unfortunately, that's all of the details the Nicotera gave up. He didn't specify any details like the sex of the zombie, what exactly will be shown on camera, or whether the more, uh, sensitive body parts will even still be there on the zombie. No matter what the answers to those questions are, it will surely be a momentous and historical moment for television.
Warning: The Walking Dead Season 8 spoiler ahead.
The eighth season of The Walking Dead starts back up with its mid-season premiere on Feb. 25, an extra-long episode that will likely send off series mainstay Carl Grimes after he was bit by a zombie — a fatal wound.
There are eight episodes left in Season 8 and Nicotera directed three of them.
