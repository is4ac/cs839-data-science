Less than a fortnight after the death of Malcolm Jefferson, his daughter Ruth saddled her first winner since inheriting his licence to train when Cyrus Darius bolted up in Kelso’s Morebattle Hurdle. Jefferson Sr, whose funeral is to take place on Friday, had won the same race with the same horse last year.“It’s me and mum now, instead of dad and mum,” Ruth told reporters, smiling in the winner’s enclosure. She has been given every reason to hope that the long established routine of the yard at Norton in North Yorkshire will continue with the support of the existing band of owners.“Everyone seems to suggest they’ll support us and we’re hopeful they will, because we’ve got a nice team of horses and staff. It’d be nice for them if they continued. We just have to do well for them!”This was supposed to be the season that Cyrus Darius switched his considerable talent to jumping fences but he has lacked fluency so far, resulting in this switch back to the smaller obstacles. “When he gets in a little bit close, he just can’t organise himself and you get some big horses like that,” Jefferson said.She will have a shot at a much more significant winner on Saturday when Waiting Patiently lines up for the Ascot Chase, for which he is 11-4 second-favourite after a stunningly easy success at Kempton last month. “It’s a tough ask but we think we deserve our place in the lineup. It’s a true Grade One; I wouldn’t write off any of them. Cue Card is Cue Card, you wouldn’t know if he’d pop up again. He’s been a hell of a horse.”Waiting Patiently and Cue Card are among seven horses left in the race at the final entry stage, with the betting headed by Top Notch at 2-1. Those who think Cue Card might rediscover his best form with Paddy Brennan back on board can get 10-1.Final entries are also in for Haydock’s Grand National Trial on Saturday, with Blaklion no bigger than 3-1 to see off his eight rivals and cement his position as favourite for the big race at Aintree on 14 April.Meanwhile, Ruby Walsh has suggested he could be back in the saddle as soon as the end of next week, having continued to receive encouragement about his recovery from a broken leg. The Irishman has been on the sidelines for three months but appears set fair to make his comeback in time for the Cheltenham Festival.Walsh said: “Things are going well. I just need to be patient and not do myself any damage. There’s no real pain any more but things can’t be rushed.”Sandown 1.20 Paddys Poem 1.50 Tara Bridge 2.25 Midnight Tune 3.00 Midnight Monty 3.30 Et Moi Alors 4.05 Vino Griego (nap) 4.35 Broken Quest Lingfield  1.30 Vale Of Kent 2.00 Oregon Gift 2.35 Dutch Uncle 3.10 Dragon Mall 3.40 King Kevin 4.15 Mrs Burbidge 4.45 Falcon’s Fire Fakenham 1.40 Hurricane Rita 2.10 Rather Be 2.45 Whiskey In The Jar (nb) 3.20 Flaming Charmer 3.50 Calipso Collonges 4.25 Premier Portrait 4.55 Midnight Monsoon Newcastle 5.45 Lukoutoldmakezebak 6.15 Wazin 6.45 Semana Santa 7.15 Ode To Autumn 7.45 Oriental Lilly 8.15 Evince 8.45 Kingstreet Lady – Tips by Chris Cook.
