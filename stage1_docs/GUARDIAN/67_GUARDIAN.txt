Alex McLeish will be unveiled as the Scotland manager for a second time on Friday, the 59-year-old having agreed a deal until 2020 as the successor to Gordon Strachan.The Scottish FA’s refusal to extend Strachan’s contract beyond the end of a failed World Cup qualifying campaign led to a strong pursuit of Michael O’Neill, which ultimately fell short as he opted to remain with Northern Ireland.McLeish had always been vocal about a willingness to manage the Scots; he did likewise in 2007 before moving to Birmingham City after 10 month in post. Discussions with Scottish FA board members on Wednesday evening led to contract negotiations on Thursday, which were swiftly concluded. A statement on Friday morning will be followed by a media conference.Walter Smith was briefly courted but withdrew from the running after becoming frustrated at a failure to arrange a meeting. Despite widespread calls to interview Steve Clarke, who has enjoyed stunning success in the short term at Kilmarnock, McLeish had the firm support of the Scottish FA’s president, Alan McRae, and vice-president, Rod Petrie.McLeish, who has been out of work since a spell with the Egyptian league side Zamalek in 2016, will be charged with ending a wait for a major finals appearance stretching back to 1998.The Scottish FA, meanwhile, must step up the hunt for a chief executive after the sudden departure of Stewart Regan. He was personally blamed by certain board members for the inability to coax O’Neill, who subsequently signed a new and lucrative contract with the Irish FA.McLeish’s arrival will not be universally popular, the manner of his exit for Birmingham 11 years ago still causing unrest among some Scotland supporters. McLeish won 77 caps for his country, while his last tenure was notable for a famous success over France in Paris.Speaking last month, McLeish shrugged off the reality of not being the Scottish FA’s first choice. “I know that Michael O’Neill was the favourite, of course, but it wouldn’t be the first time that I’ve got a job on the rebound,” he said. “When I went to Hibs for instance, [the chairman] Rod Petrie fancied Paul Sturrock, and the rest is history.“But if it’s meant to be, it’s meant to be. I’m more than open to the possibility, so we will see.”
