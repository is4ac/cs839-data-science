The last time I saw every single movie nominated for best picture at the Academy Awards before the actual starry event was in 2006. Crash won that year, and perhaps something broke in me as a result – the season had been rich in more deserving candidates, and I may never forgive the Oscars for denying Brokeback Mountain its rightful prize. Betrayal by institutions is standard, of course, but that one stung hard.Oscars season is when we sharpen knives and fall headlong into surprisingly permanent film tribes. Did George Clooney deserve his win over Jake Gyllenhaal that year? I would argue no, but I know people who will die on that hill, even now. Last year’s envelope flub was very much the cherry on top of a crystallised argument months in the making: La La Land v Moonlight. I loved both, and always will, but the pleasure that suffused my whole body when the correct name was read out had a singular heat; the rush was euphoric. I stood up at home, arms held above my head in disbelief at the penalty-shootout level of drama. For about 15 seconds, everything felt right in the world.This year, I’m torn between two very special performances in the best actor category. Two Daniels, both British. Daniel Kaluuya, talented and 28 , at the beginning of what I hope is a long career; and Daniel Day-Lewis, 60 and silver, owner of three Oscars and about to retire. I’ve told myself I’ll be fine with either one winning. And I will! But if I search my heart, I know who I want to take home the statuette, and I’m wondering if the Academy will fall in line with my deepest wishes. Fingers crossed. I want to be joyfully surprised on 4 March.
