Anyway, I guess that’s us for another day – join us tomorrow for more! Bye...Updated

Meanwhile, my colleague, Ed Aarons, sends word that Adam Pengilly, a British IOC member, has been advised to go home after an altercation which left a security guard injured. It sounds like a guard tried to block his way, he ran past, and the guard fell ands hurt himself. Full story to follow presently, but for now you can read about it here. 

9.07am EST
09:07

In the men’s ice hockey, Czech Republic lead Korea 2-1 while Canada are 4-1 up on Switzerland - both are playing the third period. 

9.05am EST
09:05

Elsewhere, Canada and Sweden are locked at 6-6, also playing an extra end. 

9.04am EST
09:04

GB are now second in the table behind Japan, who are 2-0. They really needed that – a second defeat and they were in all sorts. 

9.03am EST
09:03

And after an extra end too! 

9.03am EST
09:03

With one stane apiece remaining, it’s still one to China in the house ... but they run too far with their final effort, leaving it dead centre. If GB can play off it, they win...

8.58am EST
08:58

So at 7-7, End 11, we have a Chinese timeout. They have one stone in the house, two left to play, and GB have the hammer. 

8.56am EST
08:56

Japan have beaten Korea 7-5...

8.55am EST
08:55

Right then, scran is done, so I, I being Daniel Harris, am back. 

8.49am EST
08:49

Here comes End 11 ... 

8.48am EST
08:48

China’s captain, Wang Bingyu, plays a marvellous draw with the final shot of the 10th end, and a tie means we will play another end. Great Britain, though, will have the hammer. Eve Muirhead and co are still very much in this.

8.45am EST
08:45

Down on Sheet D, where Korea are vying with Japan, there is whooping and cheering but Muirhead is a picture of focus, as Great Britain attempt to topple China here. 

8.42am EST
08:42

The Great Britain team are all smiles out there on the ice at the moment, as Sloan sends another China stone packing. With only a couple of shots left each in this end, this really is the business end of things. 

8.36am EST
08:36

A good first shot from Lauren Gray puts Great Britain into a healthy position as China ready themselves to respond. Updated
at 8.50am EST


8.34am EST
08:34

Muirhead earns Great Britain another shot and, with the 10th end to play, they nudge themselves into a 7-6 lead. China have the hammer but trail. 

8.33am EST
08:33

A great effort by China, with an ambitious shot from the skipper but surely Great Britain will take a point in this ninth end now. The worst that can happen is that they would be level-pegging going into the final end ...

8.29am EST
08:29

As Great Britain take a time out in the curling, take a break from the action by having a wander through our gallery of day six in Pyeongchang:

8.27am EST
08:27

Back to the curling, where Anna Sloan has just played a lovely shot to give Great Britain half a chance of picking up a point or two in this ninth end.

8.24am EST
08:24

Geisenberger, Ludwig, Wendl and Arlt seal victory in 2.24.517mins. Canada take silver and Austria, who got under way with David Gleirscher, take bronze. That is Germany’s ninth gold of the Games. Updated
at 8.43am EST


8.18am EST
08:18

Muirhead plays two brilliant shots, to counteract the work of Bingyu Wang, the China captain. China have one shot to respond, but with no room for error, they take their time over getting out of a bit of pickle. But when Wang eventually delivers the final shot of the eighth end, they hit the jackpot so to speak. China lead 6-5. Updated

8.10am EST

In the men’s ice hockey, Czech Republic lead Korea 2-1 while Canada are romping away with the lead, 4-0 up over Switzerland, also in Group A.

8.03am EST
08:03

Hello! Let’s get straight into things. And at the Gangneung Curling Centre, Eve Muirhead’s Great Britain team trailed China 5-3 but have pulled level to 5-5. They are on the eighth end. Still to come? There is men’s biathlon and in the luge relay, Latvia currently lead the way. Updated

Meanwhile, in the curling, China lead GB 5-3, playing End 7; GB have the hammer. 

7.55am EST

That really was an incredible performance from Bloemen, who smashed the Olympic record which Bergsma had only just set. Bloemen is loving the moment, greeting into his hands, and well he might. 

7.54am EST
07:54

Bergsma gets silver for Netherlands, Tumolero bronze for Italy.

“Speedskating reminds of the old description of football paraphrased: They all have a turn, then the Dutch win,” emailed Mike MacKenzie. He has since thought better of it, emailing: “Speedskating reminds of the old description of football paraphrased: They all have a turn, then the Dutch win. But once in a great while a Canadian wins!”A former Dutch Canadian, but who’s splitting hairs. 

7.50am EST
07:50

Sven Kramer is 11.81 seconds outside Bloemen’s time! He’s not even going to get a medal unless he can lift it! Bloemen is already celebrating! 

7.48am EST
07:48

In the biathlon, Boe of Norway still leads. Updated
at 7.53am EST


7.47am EST
07:47

Kramer is 3.01 down on Bloemen – which is a chunk, but not insurmountable by any means. 

7.46am EST
07:46

Email! “I don’t know if you know,” begins

Biggie Smalls
 Dennis Verweij “that this morning, the Dutch press released a story in which Bergsma’s coach Anema received an official warning letter from the Dutch skating federation for match fixing in the 2014 Sochi games. But this was never released to the public until the story dropped today. The reason for the match fixing seems to be that as associate also with the French national skating federation, Anema approached the Dutch national coach, Koops, to ask that the Dutch to skate slower during the team pursuit so not to over take the french team. This is so the French team could save some face and not lose their funding.”I did not - thanks very much. Updated

This is worth your time...

7.41am EST

Sven Kramer has won every Olympic event but this one - “I don’t race to race, I race to win,” or commentator quotes him as saying. He’s going to have to go some...

7.39am EST
07:39

In the women’s curling, GB have closed to 3-4 against China, but need a double-point End or a steal. They’re playing the sixth. 

7.38am EST
07:38

He shaves 2.21s off the mark Bergsman just set, and doesn’t he just love it! What can Sven Kramer do about it? He’s about to set off in the final pair...

7.37am EST
07:37

He’s flagging but he’s pushing!

7.37am EST
07:37

Bloemen is going for gold! He takes the ball at -2.1s!

7.36am EST
07:36

Well Bloemen is piling into Bergsman! He’s 2.4s inside him at 9200m! 

7.27am EST
07:27

With about half the field in the clubhouse, Boe of Norway still leads the men’s biathlon. Updated

Ted-Jan Bloemen, who came second to Kramer in the 5000m, is underway. Nicola Tumolero of Italy is also on the ice. I’m very excited to be the first ever #Crypto Sponsored Athlete. Thanks @CEEK #VirtualReality and @Ong_Social for being at the forefront of technology and this great achievement. Looking forward to a great relationship and the exciting times ahead. pic.twitter.com/mCHbNzkKW8
