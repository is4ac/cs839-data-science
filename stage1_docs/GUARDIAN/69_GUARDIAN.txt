And why did the game fail to live up to its hype?Domestically there is the small matter of the FA’s new partnership with Qatar to ponder, the new domestic TV rights deal which is worth less than three years ago and find out why Leicester should be more up for the FA Cup than any other side ahead of the fifth round.Back on Monday!PS: Football Weekly Live returns!
