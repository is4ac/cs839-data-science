1) In case you missed it, Portugal won their first European Futsal title at the weekend, defeating Spain in extra-time. And while we’re here, why not enjoy some great Futsal Euro final goals of yesteryear.2) Mud, tumbles and a lost shoe: it’s the BUCS Cross-Country Championships in sunny Uxbridge. Also of note in the preceding race – this outstanding faceplant into the bank.3) In Pyeongchang, Swiss freeskier Fabian Bösch takes a novel approach to riding an escalator while his team-mates play bobsleigh.4) Somebody let the Philadelphia Eagles’ Jason Kelce in front of a microphone after their Superbowl win, with epic results.5) It’s the FA Cup fifth round this weekend, so gorge yourself on the pick of the goals from this time last year – Danny Graham’s effort against Manchester United for Blackburn – as well as a compilation of some of the competition’s greatest ever fifth-round goals. 6) Downhill biking insanity: Tomas Slavik tears it up in Chile. 1) “This is my back garden and I’ve never been in it before” – Luís Boa Morte shows off his Vauxhall Corsa and normal-sized bathroom in a wonderfully underwhelming retro edition of MTV Cribs. 2) Roy Hodgson drops the F-bomb after a “tricky” set of post-match questions.3) I CAME HERE FOR A SHOOT-OUT. LIKE A WESTERN. 4) Rio Ferdinand talks some sense into Manchester United youngsters after a 9-0 defeat to Manchester City. 5) Carsten Kammlott mastered the scorpion kick before it was cool. 6) Backyard Aussie bowls/curling.
