It’s been four months since revelations about the behaviour of the Hollywood producer, Harvey Weinstein, first started to emerge. In that period, there have been a slew of other allegations concerning public figures, and a wide-ranging conversation has begun too about sex and consent.One woman’s account of a date with the comedian Aziz Ansari prompted a huge amount of discussion, as did Nigella Lawson’s comment that, in rejecting an overture, women have always been told “we mustn’t make a man feel bad about anything”.We’d like to hear your stories about dating in the post-Weinstein era. Have you noticed any change in your interactions on dating sites, and in person, in this period? Has the discussion made you reconsider past dating experiences? Have you seen a change in the way consent is discussed? And have the revelations made you think twice about dating altogether? You can share your experiences in the encrypted form below.
