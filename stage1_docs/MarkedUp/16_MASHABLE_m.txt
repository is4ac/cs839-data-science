Ice and fire are once again at odds in the latest news for Winds of Winter, the long-awaited (and long-delayed) next installment of <pname>George R. R. Martin</pname>'s A Song of Fire and Ice saga.
The news is not good. There's a delay in the process. Again. This time, in a manner of speaking, it's the dragons' fault.
In exchanging comments with fans on a recent Not a Blog post, Martin shared a detail that all but confirms we won't be seeing Winds of Winter in 2018. Not unless there's a miracle.

Does anyone else feel like <pname>George</pname> is mocking us at this point?Image:   <pname>Kevin Winter</pname>/Getty ImagesThis latest round of depressing information began when a fan asked what writing <pname>Martin</pname> had planned for 2018. He responded that he was close to completing the first volume of his spin-off Targaryen family history series, Fire and Blood. Another fan asked how the timeline for that series would factor into the release of Winds of Winter. 
"F&B will be in two volumes,” he wrote, further explaining that, “Vol 1 [will come before Winds of Winter], vol 2 after."
In other words, Martin is currently focused on finishing Volume 1 of Fire and Blood in 2018, so he can then go back to Winds of Winter, then continue on to Volume 2 after that's done. (Probably in sometime in the year 2049.)
What's worse, <pname>Martin</pname> has said that a chunk of the Fire and Blood series will be ... content he's already published in The Book of Swords anthology series or from "sidebars" in The World of Ice & Fire companion book. These include the stories “The Rogue Prince,” “The Princess and the Queen” and “Sons of the Dragon."
But if our best guess is accurate, we only have to wait until 2019 for the 8th and final season of Game of Thrones.
To quote the Targaryen Mad King that <pname>Martin</pname> is evidently keen to tell us more about, perhaps it's time to just "burn it all."
