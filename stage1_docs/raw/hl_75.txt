Just a few moments ago, the 2017 Film Independent Spirit Award nominations were revealed to the public, continuing on with Phase One of the awards season. This precursor marks another new point in the race, as many of these movies nominated today will be contending for Oscar attention as well. Removed from the Academy Award race though, this is just a great precursor because of what it nominates. The films are small in budget and often need a leg up, so this is a spotlight on what the viewing public should be searching out in theaters and at home on Blu-Ray or VOD. Congrats to the nominees and read on to see who and what they were…
You’ll see all of the nominees below, but as you’ll be able to tell, it appears to be a race between Call Me By Your Name, The Florida Project, Get Out, and Lady Bird, at least for the moment. Right now, any could take home the top prizes, so it’ll be a fascinating one to watch in March. Also doing well was Columbus, Good Time, and The Rider, while it was somewhat of a soft showing for The Big Sick, The Disaster Artist, and Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. Nothing is set in stone yet, but those movies were looking for more love than they got. The films cited heavily though, they got a small boost at least.
