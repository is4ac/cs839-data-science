It’s just about time to kick things into a whole new gear. That’s right, I’m talking about weekly updates to my Academy Award predictions. Considering how we’re in the final month of 2017, it’s apt. These are the last days of the current calendar year, so anything hoping to get Oscar love had better reveal itself soon. Aside from potentially All the Money in the World, The Greatest Showman, and Star Wars: The Last Jedi, everything has been seen, embargo or no embargo. This will all change in the next week or so, which is exciting. Crunch time folks! That’s where we’re at now.
Below are a completely new set of picks, utilizing some critics groups wins (New York and Los Angeles), the National Board of Review citations, and some thoughts about what the Golden Globes will do next week (final Globe predictions will be up on Friday). What you’ll see here is that reflection, as well as some general hunches on my part. Notably, I’ve at least temporarily gone out on a limb and put Lady Bird into the number one spot for Best Picture. That may change, but for the moment, that’s where I’m at. Other changes across the board can be seen, so let us cut to the chase and get down to brass tacks…
