The French side took the lead through Adrien Rabiot but Ronaldo equalised from the penalty spot just before half-time.
The Portugal forward then put the hosts ahead with seven minutes left before left-back Marcelo's close-range finish gave the holders a two-goal cushion to take to Paris.
The world was watching as two of the most expensively assembled squads in world football collided at the Bernabeu, with much of the pre-match attention focusing on Neymar and Ronaldo.
It was the prodigious boy wonder who drew first blood for his side, with the Brazilian’s cute backheel delicately falling into the path of the onrushing Rabiot.
However, the Spanish champions grew into the game and showed exactly why they have managed to retain the Champions League trophy.
Giovani Lo Celso, who looked overawed by the occasion, needlessly brought down Toni Kroos late in the first half in the box.
33-year-old Ronaldo stepped up and duly dispatched the penalty to leave the scores level going into the break.
As the second half began, Kylian Mbappe reminded the world of his phenomenal young talent by drawing a smart save from Keylor Navas at the start of the second half.
However, the hosts took the lead when Alphonse Areola was unable to keep out a stinging shot which fell perfectly into the path of Ronaldo – who didn’t know an awful lot about the goal.
The introduction of Marco Asensio changed the course of the game completely and he helped set up the third, potentially conclusive goal, when his cut back was met on the volley by the marauding Marcelo.
