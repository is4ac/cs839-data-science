The 21-year-old midfielder arrived at the Bernabeu in the summer but has struggled to establish himself in the side.
Ceballos has started just two LaLiga games and is already being linked with a move away as he bids to secure regular first-team football.
Both Liverpool and Arsenal are said to be keeping close tabs on his situation in Madrid, while Inter Milan are hopeful of luring him to the San Siro.
But now his friend Adan says Ceballos would only consider throwing the towel in on his move to Madrid if Betis were able to offer him a return.
The youngster, who was born in Seville, came through the ranks at his hometown club before making an impact in the first team.
Now Adan has revealed that Ceballos came close to heading back there in January and would be open to the switch in the future.
He told ABC de Sevilla: "Dani wanted to return to Betis last month.
"I spoke with him directly and there was the possibility of him returning the club, and he wanted to if it was possible.
"If there was the possibility of him returning to Betis he would do it, we are the one club he would consider leaving Madrid for.
"It is not only Dani who wanted it, the coach [Quique Setien] did too but it was only due to technical issues that he could not come back.
"He has improved as a player despite not playing as many games as he would like to, he is a different one than when he left us and I'm convinced he will be a success at Madrid."
