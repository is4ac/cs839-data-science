The Barcelona Twitter account posted a video compilation of the Argentine's best moments in a training session and some of them were truly wonderful. 
At one point in the video, Messi received a pass straight at him before teeing himself up and lobbing the keeper, and Messi had his back to goal throughout. 
Messi's side face Chelsea in the Champions League next week and it looks like the Blues will have their work cut out if the five-time Ballon D'or winner is in this kind of form. 
Watch the amazing video below...
