Arnautovic, fit again after three games out injured, put in a sensational display as the Hammers grabbed a crucial three points to ease their relegation fears.
West Ham look a totally different team when the Austrian, a £24million summer signing from Stoke, gets on the ball and his late goal killed off the Hornets after Javier Hernandez had opened the scoring.
But Hammers boss Moyes insisted: "He's getting no praise.
"He'll be told to keep at it, he'll keep getting pushed all the way. We are not letting him off the hook, he's got a bit to go.
"He only trained for three days but you can see the impact he's had, and playing as a centre-forward has freed him up a bit.
"He has power, pace, he's good on the ball. He’s doing a really good job for us. In fact he should have scored more."
The only thing more striking than Arnautovic's performance was his new bleach-blond hairstyle.
Moyes, clearly keen to not upset his star man, was more than complimentary to the Austrain about his new ‘do.
"When he came in with it yesterday I said 'that looks great Marko, it really suits you', so he went away happy," added Moyes.
"I thought it was a purple rinse."
