Liverpool bought the Egyptian forward for a relatively modest £34million in June and he has looked to be worth his weight in gold so far.
The 25-year-old has scored a staggering 22 times in just 26 Premier League games while his goal against Porto on Wednesday night moved him to 30 in all competitions.
His incredible form has left some Roma fans feeling short-changed and, although Monchi admits they could have maybe got more money out of Liverpool, he insists the Italian club had little choice but to sell.
Monchi told Sky Sport Italia: “At the end of the day, we could reach €50m with bonuses, but at that moment we had to sell and that was an important option.
“The Neymar and Kylian Mbappe transfers changed the market, but at that moment it was necessary that we sell.
“I still think the price could’ve been better for Salah, but it did give us the possibility of making other moves. When I arrived, the Liverpool offer for Salah was €32m plus €3m in bonuses. In today’s football, players go wherever they want to.
“The figures are important, because at the end of the day we are a business, but the fans cannot be bought. In my years at Sevilla, people counted the trophies and those are so far missing at Roma.
“I understand the fans perfectly well, I know they don’t want to talk about numbers, they just want to win, but that is my job. We have to build a club that doesn’t just win, but does so consistently over time. Fans don’t want promises, they want results.
“I accept all of that, but ask them for a little faith. It takes time. We’ve got to stay quiet and work harder to find the right path towards what the fans want.”
