As you’re reading this, members of the Academy have been officially voting for the Oscars. Final choices are being made, with contenders having done everything possible to attract votes their way. Now, they’ll just have to wait. Voters have a week to fill out their ballots, with the ceremony a few days after. We’re under two weeks now from the actual Academy Awards ceremony, if you can believe it. Final predictions will be next week, so consider this potentially the penultimate picks below. I may update one more time before then if necessary…we shall see. Instead, it may be a look at a voter’s ballot or something like that. Sit tight.
Right now, it feels like a three horse race for Best Picture, with the winner also probably taking Best Original Screenplay as well. All the other major categories are wrapped up, and in Picture, there’s only the smallest possibilities that either Dunkirk or Lady Bird could pull the upset. Otherwise, it’s between Get Out, The Shape of Water, and Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri for top honors. If Original Screenplay pushes one to the top, it’ll either be Get Out or Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, hence their leaping over The Shape of Water lately. Below the line, it’ll be interesting to see how voters choose between Blade Runner 2049, Dunkirk, and The Shape of Water in various categories, or if we’re going to see an upset in favor of something like Baby Driver. It could happen. For now, new predictions below…
