The 28-year-old has slipped down the pecking order at Old Trafford this season and he is reportedly considering his future at the club.
Milan are keen to bring the Spaniard to Italy and have been tracking him for a number of months.
The San Siro club are ready to make a formal offer this summer and, according to Tuttosport, they believe they can get Herrera for Â£30m.
Milan hope the midfielder's lack of playing time could play into their hands and they are prepared to drive a hard bargain.
Herrera, who joined United in 2014, will also have only a year left on his contract come the summer.
