In the wee hours of the morning, the British Academy announced their BAFTA nominations, putting into place yet another major Oscar precursor. This voting block, known as the British vote, does hold some sway with the Academy. At the Academy Awards, they represent a solid portion of membership, so while SAG will always be the largest delegation, this one isn’t too far behind. That makes it a precursor worth taking note of. Obviously, as you’ll see below, there are some release date oddities that push some films from last year into this year, and of course exclude some of this year’s contenders until next year. That’s just how it goes with BAFTA…
Leading the way was The Shape of Water with a dozen nominations, far ahead of any other film. Those 12 citations set the pace, while next in line were Darkest Hour and Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri with nine each. Close behind were Blade Runner 2049 and Dunkirk, as they both had eight nominations apiece. BAFTA also marked a slightly mixed bag for Lady Bird, a shut out for certain contenders (see the slight caveat above), and showcased unexpectedly (or perhaps expectedly, considering) strong showings for both Film Stars Don’t Die in Liverpool and Paddington 2. The full nominations are next, so take a gander and see what you think. As always, BAFTA had something distinct to say.
