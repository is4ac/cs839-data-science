The 18-year-old son of Dutch icon Patrick Kluivert is currently impressing at Ajax after breaking into the first-team last season.
The teenager has played 33 times in the Eredivisie already, scoring eight goals, and scouts from around Europe are already circling.
He has been regularly linked with a move to England, where his dad spent time at Newcastle United during his playing days.
However the Toon Army was not among the clubs Kluivert Jr. name-checked when discussing his future.
The youngster told Helden: “If you get a nice offer, you never know.
“England appeals to me: Arsenal, Tottenham, Chelsea or Manchester United are nice clubs where I can see myself playing in a few years.”
