The 24-year-old has long been linked with a move to England after impressing in Italy over the past few seasons.
Manchester United have often been reported as the Lazio midfielderâ€™s most likely destination as they have scouted him on numerous occasions.
But now, according to Il Messaggero, it is Chelsea who are lining up a summer bid for Anderson.
The Blues are said to be in the market for a creative midfielder and scouts believe the Brazilian fits the bill.
Interest from Manchester United in Anderson has cooled, but Napoli are reportedly keeping tabs on his situation.
