There are no wages spent at all," Chichester manager Matt Wright told BBC Sport.

"I was over the moon when we got Liverpool. It's a huge draw."Wright added: "They're a big name, which means we'll draw a good crowd in and they're a good opponent so it'll give us a good benchmark of where we're at compared to them."There's a huge divide at the moment between the resources in the Super League and the Premier League and we're probably at the bottom-end of the resource ladder."Captain Emma Alexander added: "To be able to play against England internationals, the girls are excited to have that opportunity to show what they're about."A lot of our girls have played at high levels and probably could play higher, so it's a good opportunity for them."'Reaching the last 16 is unbelievable'
