Speaking after Spurs’ 2-2 draw with Juventus in the Champions League, the boss said: "It is very sad news but he opens a door for his future with his family.
“Ryan has been at the training ground in recent days. We have been talking to him with [head of academy,] John McDermott.
“He will be successful in whatever he does. He will always be a special player for me
“He represents for me this change in all when we arrived at Tottenham.
“The door is open for me to help him; and the club because we love him and Rachel and George and all his family.
"Don’t worry Ryan, you’re going to be a successful person outside of the club.”
