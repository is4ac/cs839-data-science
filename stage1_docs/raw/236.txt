Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) accused President Trump    of obstructing justice by declining to release the Democratic response to the GOP surveillance memo.Trump on Friday said he would not declassify the memo, which outlines House Intelligence Committee Democrats’ rebuttal to the GOP document that accuses the FBI and Justice Department of surveillance abuses.“Refusal to release Democratic response to #NunesMemo - evidence of obstruction of justice by Donald Trump happening in real time,” Blumenthal tweeted.Trump cited national security concerns in deciding to block the release of the memo, which the committee voted earlier this week to release.Democrats accused Trump of exhibiting a double standard by blocking the memo after approving the release of the GOP document last week over the objections of the FBI.“Trump’s refusal to release Democratic response to #NunesMemo makes a mockery of national security and common sense,” Blumenthal tweeted.“This political ploy reveals the White House’s one-sided transparency. But the public sees through it - the #NunesMemo fell with a deafening thud.”Refusal to release Democratic response to #NunesMemo - evidence of obstruction of justice by Donald Trump happening in real time.— Richard Blumenthal (@SenBlumenthal) February 9, 2018Democrats have come out in droves to criticize Trump’s decision, with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi    (D-Calif.) saying that Trump must have "something to hide."Some GOP lawmakers have also blasted the move, saying the American people should have the opportunity to read both memos.
