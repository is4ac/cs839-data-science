I was fine with that because I am learning under the manager since I came here."I've been involved in teams that have been to the Scottish Cup finals and semi-finals, but was always on the bench."Hopefully that's something that I can be part of, and in the Europa League hopefully we can qualify and do one better than the last couple of seasons."That's the main reasons for me staying here, as well as the manager and a good set of boys."
