Moments ago, the Producers Guild of America announced their nominees, to go along with yesterday’s nominations by the Art Directors Guild and the Writers Guild of America. Having this troika of guilds is an important moment in the awards season, especially with the flashier Golden Globe ceremony just two days away. With just the Directors Guild of America still to announce, a solid portion of the precursors that matter for the major categories have had their say, nomination wise at least. Academy Award voting is getting underway too, so this information is vital. By next week, many voters will have made their ultimate choices and submitted ballots.
This trio of precursors has helped establish some films as potentially sitting pretty with Oscar. The ADG nominations basically just narrowed the field to 15 in Best Production Design, give or take a few. The WGA nominations gave I, Tonya a big boost, allowed Logan to have life, and kept potential nominees like The Big Sick and The Disaster Artist firmly in line for citations. As for PGA, they surprised with 11 nominees, allowing the nine main presumed Oscar contenders to be joined by Molly’s Game and Wonder Woman, at the expense of The Florida Project. Plenty to chew on here, ladies and gentlemen…
