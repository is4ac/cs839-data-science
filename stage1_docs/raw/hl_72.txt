For those of you not going shopping on Black Friday, today is also a noteworthy day in that it’s the final Friday of November. We’re days away from the embargo on The Post lifting (I’ve seen it but can’t say anything yet), while Phantom Thread is about to screen for the first time this weekend. Then, it’ll just be The Greatest Showman and Star Wars: The Last Jedi among unseen question marks this season. As such, now is a great time for new Academy Award predictions. The race is changing and about to change again. Let us take its temperature and see what’s what right now…
Below you will see yet another updated set of predictions. It does reflect having seen The Post, so make what you will of that, but it’s without having seen Phantom Thread yet, so just know that. For now, you’ll also notice upward mobility for Lady Bird, which is really in a great spot. Aside from that, a lot remains the same, with Dunkirk and Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri poised to duke it out for Best Picture. As more precursors chime in, we’ll have a better idea of how accurate that is. For now, it seems as logical as any other outcome.
