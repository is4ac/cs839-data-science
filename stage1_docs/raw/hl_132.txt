It’s slowly turning into the fall, weather wise. At the same time, the films are beginning to become more and more prestige laden. The Academy Awards are still a ways off, but predictions need to continually evolve, now that we’re more than halfway through the festival season. As such, a laser focus on the awards season is what’s required now. Only a select few Oscar hopefuls have yet to screen for any pundits, and with that, there aren’t a lot of X factors in the race. You’ll shortly see what I think it all will turn out as for now, but this is just a drop in the bucket. The real moves will be made over the coming weeks. Stay tuned there.
First, a bit of housekeeping to take care of. We’ve had Lean on Pete and You Were Never Really Here turn into 2018 releases, so cross them off. They’re out of the 2017 calendar and awards race. Below, you’ll see my picks for the moment, including a big surge for The Disaster Artist. The lineup always looks better with a big crowd pleaser, and this film could end up being the one. That’s just one change that you’ll notice within these predictions, but there are plenty more to be found. Sift through them and prepare for even more next month, as it’s just that time of year…
