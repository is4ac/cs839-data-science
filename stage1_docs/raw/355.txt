The midfielder went on strike for ten days after a deadline day move to Manchester City fell through.
Although he returned to the matchday squad against Pep Guardiola’s side last Saturday, there was still intense speculation the Algerian was not in the right frame of mind.
However, Puel has been so impressed with the 26-year-old in training, he may even start the Foxes’ FA Cup tie at home to Sheffield United.
Asked whether Mahrez had returned in as good a shape as before his absence, Puel said: "I think better.
"He enjoys to play and train with his team-mates and he is at a good level with no problem. He has come back with a smile. The story is behind him, all the players want to move on.
"It is important to put an end to the talking about Riyad, he came back to the game at Manchester City. We need to move on, for him he needs to kick on, like the team the most important thing is in front of us."
