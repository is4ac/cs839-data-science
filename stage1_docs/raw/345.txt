Pochettino, the 45-year-old former Argentina international, is regarded as one of the finest coaches in the game right now. He has guided Spurs to incredible heights since his appointment as manager in 2014, and is said to be on the radars of Real Madrid, Paris Saint-Germain, and Tottenham’s local rivals Chelsea.
He signed a five-year contract in 2016 which means there is no pressure on Spurs to rush to an agreement with Pochettino, though The Telegraph say the north Londoners are ready to open talks about a new deal.
Daniel Levy, the Tottenham chairman, wants Pochettino to lead Spurs into their new stadium, and he is willing to offer the Argentine a rise to his current £5.5m-a-year wage packet.
Earlier this season, Pochettino revealed he would love to stay with the Lilywhites for ’10 to 15 years’ as he is ‘so happy’ to be manager of Spurs.
