Over the weekend, specifically on Saturday night, two big precursors went down. The Directors Guild of America Awards and the Annie Awards were held, help to solidify two Oscar categories. Yes, as you’ll see, there’s now no mystery left about what the Academy Awards will cite in the Best Director and Best Animated Feature races. Frankly, there hasn’t been for some time now, but the last pieces of the puzzle were put together on Saturday. Those two categories are coronations now, and rightly so, quality wise. With DGA being the final Guild, that also really does launch us firmly into Phase Two, where members of the Academy will be making their final decisions about who and what will receive Oscar gold.
Below you’ll be able to see Annie and DGA results, which probably shouldn’t have surprised anyone. The former went for Coco across the board, while the latter went the obvious routes in the two major categories. Guillermo del Toro took the big prize for The Shape of Water, while Jordan Peele took the First Timer award for Get Out. The only surprise was, ever so slightly, that City of Ghosts and Matthew Heineman took the win in the Documentary category. That doesn’t help the Oscar race there, as the doc isn’t nominated, so make of that what you will. Other than that, del Toro is a lock to take Best Director, while Coco is just as big a lock in Best Animated Feature.
