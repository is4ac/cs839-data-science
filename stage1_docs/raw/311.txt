Arsenal have travelled to Sweden to take on minnows Ostersund in the Europa League round-of-32 on Thursday.
This is Ostersund’s first ever European season, and they have progressed to the knockout stage of the Europa League by defeating the likes of Galatasaray, PAOK and Hertha Berlin.
The Gunners made it to the last-32 by finishing top of their group, though Arsene Wenger will not be able to select January signing Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang in the Europa League as his former side Borussia Dortmund are also in the competition and he is ineligible in case the two sides have to face one another.
So, who has been selected for the clash? The confirmed teams can be seen, in full, below…

Ostersund XI: Keita, Mkukiibi, Papagiannopoulos, Pettersson, Widgren, Edwards, Nouri, Mensah, Sema, Ghoddos, Gero
