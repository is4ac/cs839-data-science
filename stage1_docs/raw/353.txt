The in-demand striker's clause, which is valid in July, has come under much scrutiny of late with both Manchester United and Real Madrid reportedly ready to activate it this summer.
As a result, the Italian giants have been working overtime to try and tie the Argentine down to a new and improved contract.
Corriere dello Sport have released details of Inter's latest proposal and they are looking to increase Icardi’s salary by almost £2m, from £4.1m per-season to £6.1m, along with a lucrative set of bonuses linked to team and individual achievements.
Additionally, Inter would like to remove the £80m release clause from Icardi's contract to snare off potential interest in the summer.
However, Icardi's entourage, headed by his wife and agent Wanda, are asking for a salary of £6.5m and want to keep the clause but raise it to £135m.
If Inter were to remove the clause entirely, Icardi is likely to demand closer to £7m per season in order to prolong his stay at the San Siro.
