CONTINUING  “4,380 Nights.” “A serpentine affair by Annalisa Dias, mainly set in a Guantanamo Bay holding cell, stretching terrorism paranoia to include atrocities in 19th century Algeria, and even back to Roman times. It’s a lush historical buffet — and D.C.’s third show in the past year to focus on a prisoner in an orange jumpsuit, chained to the floor — but a lot to digest.” (Nelson Pressley) Part of the Women’s Voices Theater Festival.

READ MORE: Playwrights Mary Kathryn Nagle and Annalisa Dias take on U.S. history   “La Foto (The Photo).” “Former high school sweethearts reconnect online decades later, and one of the erstwhile lovers sends off a risqué selfie. Bad move! The snapshot upends lives and creates public scandal. The serviceable humor sometimes cedes to affecting seriousness, but Gustavo Ott, a Washington-based Venezuelan playwright, devotes too much fleeting attention to too many characters, most of whom are more circumstance than personality.” (Celia Wren) Read the review Through Feb. 25 at GALA Hispanic Theatre, 3333 14th St. NW. Tickets $45. Call 202-234-7174 or visit galatheatre.org.   “The Great Society.” “Lyndon Johnson wins the 1964 election but loses his soul and goes to hell. American cities burn and Vietnam drags him under by the lapels of his rumpled gray suit; in Kyle Donnelly’s enveloping production at Arena Stage the flames actually lick at LBJ from below. ‘The Great Society’ is Robert Schenkkan’s sequel to ‘All the Way,’ the Tony-winning drama that displayed Johnson in full wheeler-dealer mode, and the show is driven by Jack Willis’s performance as LBJ — a growling, full-throttle turn with the energy of a Mack truck roaring downhill.” (Nelson Pressley) Read the review Through March 11 at Arena Stage, 1101 Sixth St. SW. Tickets $40-$110, subject to change. Call 202-488-3300 or visit arenastage.org.   “Hamlet.” “A miscalculated performance by Michael Urie, whose idea of taking a fresh bite out of the title character involves chewing the scenery and then practically gorging on it. Set in a Denmark that’s run by the apparatus of the deep state — the something rotten is the surveillance network of the usurping King Claudius (Alan Cox) that even catches the ghost of Hamlet’s father (Keith Baxter) on its cameras — Michael Kahn’s ‘Hamlet’ suggests a royal court perched on a sterile, technocratic promontory. As a nesting ground for spies, it’s not a safe space for a voluble character such as the one Urie embodies.” (Peter Marks) Read the review Through March 4 at Shakespeare Theatre Company’s Sidney Harman Hall, 610 F St. NW. Tickets $44-$118. Call 202-547-1122 or visit shakespearetheatre.org.   READ MORE: Michael Urie on playing Hamlet     Madeleine Potter and Michael Urie in Shakespeare Theatre Company's “Hamlet.” (Scott Suchman)   “Handbagged.” “If you’ve been feasting on ‘The Crown,’ Moira Buffini’s delectable ‘Handbagged’ will skip you ahead to the Thatcher years. The fast-paced British play freely imagines meetings between the prim queen and the steely Iron Lady, and they don’t agree on much — not even, in this comically self-aware show, whether there should be an intermission. Buffini’s London hit is getting a spiffy U.S. debut at the Round House Theatre courtesy of Indhu Rubasingham, the show’s original director and head of London’s influential Tricycle Theatre. The light of history glints differently depending on who’s telling it, and Rubasingham’s production is so sure-footed that the whole show shines.” (Nelson Pressley) Read the review Part of the Women’s Voices Theater Festival. Through March 3 at Round House Theatre, 4545 East-West Highway, Bethesda. Tickets $36-$65. Call 240-644-1100 or visit roundhousetheatre.org.    “It’s the Rest of the World that Looks So Small (A Theatrical Revue of Jonathan Coulton).” “There’s no denying Flying V’s affinity with Coulton, the singer-songwriter known for his witty, geekdom-informed songs, which include matter-of-fact sci-fi fantasias and portraits of yearning office drones. Both Coulton and Flying V explore off-the-beaten-track ideas with arch humor. But the singing in the show can be unpolished, and the performances suggest a precocious collegiate undertaking rather than a fine-tuned professional effort.” (Celia Wren) Read the review. Through Feb. 25 at the Silver Spring Black Box, 8641 Colesville Rd., Silver Spring. Tickets $20. Visit flyingvtheatre.com.   “Love Is a Blue Tick Hound.” “Four short plays that confirm Audrey Cefaly’s knack for honest, quiet talk and American South reality. ‘Fin & Euba,’ the opener, eavesdrops on two young women unwinding one evening out back of the run-down boardinghouse they both hate. Cefaly does not sugarcoat the choices: Having even a little something can seem safer than risking it for something better. That’s echoed in ‘The Gulf,’ about two girlfriends in a fishing boat. The staging is modest by Baltimore’s Rapid Lemon Productions, but Cefaly’s deliberately crafted regional voice and unhurried cadence come through clearly.” (Nelson Pressley) Read the review Part of the Women’s Voices Theater Festival. Through Feb. 17 at the Trinidad Theatre, Logan Fringe Arts Space, 1358 Florida Ave. NE. Tickets $25. Call 866-811-4111 or visit capitalfringe.org.   “Skeleton Crew.” Dominique Morisseau’s blue collar Detroit drama, staged at Studio Theatre last fall, is produced by Baltimore Center Stage as part of the Women’s Voices Theater Festival. Through March 4 at Baltimore Center Stage, 700 North Calvert St., Baltimore. Tickets $20-$64. Call 410-332-0033 or visit centerstage.org.   “Something Rotten!” “A musical spoofing musicals. ‘How do you solve a problem like Ophelia?’ someone asks as everything you know about theater gets pureed at high speed. A bitter rival of Shakespeare’s goes to a soothsayer to see what audiences will want in the future, so he can write a hit now. The answer is musicals — ‘Musicals!’ the poufy-pants characters gush with wonder, looking up and spreading their arms. This leads to anachronistic inside jokes about singing cats and fiddlers on roofs.” (Nelson Pressley) Read the review Through Feb. 18 at the National Theatre, 1321 Pennsylvania Ave. NW. Tickets $48-$203. Call 800-514-3849 or visit thenationaldc.com.     “Something Rotten!” at the National Theatre. (Jeremy Daniel)   “Sovereignty.” “Mary Kathryn Nagle’s placid, teachable-moment brand of drama about the U.S. government’s contentious, centuries-long relationship with Indian tribal rights. ‘Sovereignty’ travels back and forth between the 1830s and the ‘near future,’ and Supreme Court battles going back two centuries. Those cases involve challenges to a tribe’s rights to prosecute non-Indians for crimes committed within Indian-governed territory. It’s not until the start of Act 2, unfortunately, that the modern-day story of a Yale-trained Cherokee lawyer who has come home to work for the tribe gains some emotional traction.” (Peter Marks) Read the review Part of the Women’s Voices Theater Festival. Through Feb. 18 at Arena Stage, 1101 Sixth St. SW. Tickets $40-$111, subject to change. Call 202-488-3300 or visit arenastage.org.   “The Trial.” “The artistically serious, ­movement-based Synetic Theater takes one of its more unfortunate detours with a grotesquely expressionistic, barely coherent adaptation of ‘The Trial,’ Franz Kafka’s early-20th-century dystopian novel. Save for Josef K, everyone in this ‘Trial’ is a bug. While the notion gives the capable costume designer Erik Teague the keys to Synetic’s fancifully creative treasure chest, it propels Nathan Weinberger’s adaptation into the realm of overanxious cartoon.” (Peter Marks) Read the review Through Feb. 18 at Synetic Theater, 1800 S. Bell St., Arlington. Tickets $35-$60. Call 866-811-4111 or visit synetictheater.org.   “The Trojan Women Project.” “A rambling cry that’s slightly Greek and fully Trump-era. An ensemble of 13 women in solid colored sheath dresses winds among an audience that’s grouped in twos and threes; it’s a choreopoem, to use Ntzoke Shange’s ‘for colored girls’ term, riffing on the shock of the 2016 election and the fissures still dividing seemingly everything — country, neighbors, women.” (Nelson Pressley) Read the review Part of the Women’s Voices Theater Festival, and performed in rep with “Coriolanus.” Through Feb. 25 at The Lab at Convergence, 1819 N. Quaker Lane, Alexandria. Tickets $20. Visit bravespiritstheatre.com.     Nicole Ruthmarie in “The Trojan Women Project.” (Claire Kimball)   “The Wolves.” “Sarah DeLappe’s 95 minute play manages to illuminate with unerring accuracy the psyches of the funny, inquisitive, garrulous, anxious, profane, passionate players in a ferociously competitive high school girls’ weekend soccer league. The characters come across as so authentically specific it’s as if DeLappe pinpointed each of them on the closest-in setting on Google Maps.” (Peter Marks) Read the review Part of the Women’s Voices Theater Festival. Through March 4 at Studio Theatre, 1501 14th St. NW. Tickets $52-$85, subject to change. Call 202-332-3300 or visit studiotheatre.org.  CLOSING  “The Consul, The Tramp, and America’s Sweetheart.” “Performed in the round in a space at the Lakeforest Mall (where ambient noise is a problem), John Morogiello’s play tells of an effort by Germany’s government to halt production of ‘The Great Dictator.’ The genre is comedy-peppered drama; the play’s central showdown feels labored.” (Celia Wren) Read the review Through Feb. 10 at Best Medicine Rep, Lakeforest Mall, Gaithersburg. Tickets $25. Visit bestmedicinerep.org.   “Imogen.” “An adaptation of Shakespeare’s crazily plotted ‘Cymbeline’ that fits the city’s current Women’s Voices Theater Festival by foregrounding ‘the woman’s part,’ to borrow from a notorious misogynistic speech in the play. Imogen is angry King Cymbeline’s exiled daughter, and the story has always largely been hers. Driving home the point, director Charlie Marie McGrath’s staging makes the king a wee hand puppet manipulated by his mischievous, power-mad queen.” Read the review Through Feb. 11 at The Dance Loft on 14, 4618 14th St. NW. Tickets $30. Visit pointlesstheatre.com.   “In Search of My Father: Walkin’ Talkin Bill Hawkins.” W. Allen Taylor’s solo show about searching for his father, Cleveland’s first black disc jockey. Through Feb. 10 at the Atlas Performing Arts Center, 1333 H St. NE. Tickets $20-$35. Call 202-399-7993 or visit atlas.org.   “See Rock City.” “The second part of Arlene Hutton’s ‘Nibroc Trilogy,’ after ‘Last Train to Nibroc’ introduced the easygoing young writer Raleigh and the proper, tightly wound avid reader May. They fell in love but Hutton kept you off balance, and in last year’s Washington Stage Guild production Wood Van Meter and Lexi Langs acted it with chemistry to burn. Van Meter and Langs are back, and Hutton naturally unearths how things could have gotten tough for a young man medically discharged from the Army, and for a working woman in the 1940s.” (Nelson Pressley) Read the review Through Feb. 11 at Washington Stage Guild, Undercroft Theatre in the Mount Vernon Place United Methodist Church, 900 Massachusetts Ave. NW. Tickets $50-$ 60. Call 202-582-0050 or visit stageguild.org.   “The Skin of Our Teeth.” “A harder play to reanimate than Thornton Wilder’s similarly simple-yet-cosmic ‘Our Town.’ Constellation Theatre’s production is a straight-up serving of the famously twisted show about the across-the-eons Antrobus family. ‘I don’t understand a word of this play,’ housekeeper Sabina gripes to us. Tonya Beckman, whose performance deepens appreciably by the show’s darkening end, peevishly gives us these asides but then regroups as Sabina, carrying on. That, says Wilder, is what we do.” (Nelson Pressley) Read the review Through Feb. 11 at Source, 1835 14th St. NW. Tickets $25-$55. Call 202-204-7741 or visit constellationtheatre.org.    “This Is All Just Temporary.” “Lauren (Fabiolla da Silva) has moved back home, where her parents (Taunya Ferguson and David Walsh) cope with their increasingly aggressive autistic son, Noah. Olivia Haller’s script is compassionate and apparently deeply informed but stylistically staid, and the Convergence Theatre production is often wooden.” (Celia Wren) Read the review Part of the Women’s Voices Theater Festival.

Visit convergencetheatre.org.   “Unnecessary Farce.” “Premiered in Michigan in 2006, dramatist Paul Slade Smith’s crowd-pleaser has aired in over 240 productions to date. The play is a proficient whirlwind of loopy situations and harebrained impostures, and it features a bagpipes-playing hit man. The Keegan performances are more competent than lustrous, but the characterizations are clear and droll.” (Celia Wren) Read the review Through Feb. 10 at Keegan Theatre, 1742 Church St. NW.

Erica Dorfler, Daniel Morgan and Brandon Espinoza in Theresa Rebeck’s comedy “The Way of the World.” (Teresa Wood)   “Waxing West.” “Absurdism earns its keep in Saviana Stanescu’s hallucinatory play, now on view in an engaging, if coltish, 4615 Theatre Company production. There’s a droll kookiness to the crooning by the undead Elena Ceausescu — in real life, wife to Romania’s longtime dictator. But the moment also conveys the disorientation of the play’s heroine, Daniela, a Romanian cosmetologist who moves to New York to marry a stranger.” (Celia Wren) Read the review Part of the Women’s Voices Theater Festival. Through Feb. 10 at The Highwood Theatre, 914 Silver Spring Ave., Silver Spring. Tickets $16.50. Call 301-928-2738 or visit 4615theatre.com.   “The Way of the World.” “In this unripe transplanting of ‘The Way of the World’ to Long Island’s over-pampered East End, the material doesn’t reveal much of anything about the rich and shallow we haven’t heard elsewhere — with more devastating bite. Theresa Rebeck, the prolific playwright who shepherded the Broadway-centric ‘Smash’ to television, writes amusingly well about modern problems. But most of the easy jokes in this new ‘Way of the World’ come across as stale.” (Peter Marks) Read the review Part of the Women’s Voices Theater Festival.

Laura Schellhardt’s hour-long story deals with a schoolgirl coping with the loss of her father. In her grief, the science-minded kid (played by the entirely likable Alina Collins Maldonado) is visited by the ghost of 19th century paleontologist Mary Anning (Jackie Reneé Robinson, in a formidable Mary Poppins mode).” (Nelson Pressley) Part of the Women’s Voices Theater Festival.
