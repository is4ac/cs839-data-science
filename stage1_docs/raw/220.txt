Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell    (R-Ky.) and Minority Leader Charles Schumer    (D-N.Y.) traded quips about bourbon at an event in Kentucky on Monday. Schumer presented McConnell with a bottle of Brooklyn Bourbon at the University of Louisville's McConnell Center, declaring that Brooklyn, his hometown, has the best bourbon. "Here's another thing you might not realize we have in common: bourbon. It turns out that Brooklyn, where I was born, raised and still proudly live, produces some of the best bourbon in the world," Schumer said. "I know that's a contentious thing to say in these parts, but I think it's true," he continued. "There's no such thing as Brooklyn bourbon," McConnell said to laughter. Schumer and McConnell have repeatedly butted heads on a slew of issues including health care, immigration, and tax reform. The rare of show of camaraderie between the Senate leaders comes after the two struck a government funding deal.Schumer agreed to speak at the McConnell Center after the vote, and invited McConnell, a University of Louisville basketball fan, to New York when his team plays New York's Syracuse University.
