Both clubs impressed in the Champions League this week, with the Reds thrashing Porto 5-0 and Spurs coming back from 2-0 down to draw 2-2 with Juventus.
But rather than focus on their performances, Keane chose to single out their lack of silverware, with the Liverpool last tasting glory in 2012 and Spurs potless since 2008.
He told ITV: "For a club the size of Liverpool - or Tottenham - one trophy in tenÂ years is embarrassing.
"The Champions League has taken over, particularly with the money involved, but to be successful at those clubs, it is about winning trophies.
"Liverpool and Spurs should be able to compete in the Champions League, get to the knockout stages, and win an FA Cup or League Cup. That should go hand in hand."
