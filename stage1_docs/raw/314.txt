The Colombian ace joined Bayern in the summer on a two-year loan having fallen down the pecking order at the Bernabeu.
Bayern paid £9m for the loan deal and agreed a fee of £31m should they want to land him on a permanent basis at any point during the two years.
However, as talkSPORT told you, it was reported in Spain last month that Liverpool were very keen on signing Rodriguez as a ready-made replacement for Philippe Coutinho who joined Barcelona.
They failed to complete a deal for him before the window closed but have been linked with a summer move for the 26-year-old midfielder.
But they may have just left it too late as, according to Bild, Bayern are ready to pull the trigger on their £31m agreement and keep him in Germany for good.
The former Porto man has played 16 times in the Bundesliga so far this term, scoring four goals.
