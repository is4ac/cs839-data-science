Meghan McCain said Saturday that her father, Sen. John McCain    (R-Ariz.), is doing well in his fight against brain cancer. "He's doing really good, all things considered," Meghan McCain said on CNN. "He had sort of a bad bout at Christmas time. He was hospitalized at Walter Reed. He had ramifications from his chemotherapy. He had pneumonia. But he's made this, like, really incredible comeback." John McCain was diagnosed in July with glioblastoma, an aggressive form of brain cancer, after he underwent a minor procedure to remove a block clot from above his left eye. Since then, John McCain has undergone rounds of chemotherapy and radiation at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md., near Walter Reed. Sen. Jeff Flake    (R-Ariz.) said he visited with John McCain Saturday, and that his Senate colleague appears to be "working hard and gaining strength."Had a nice visit with @SenJohnMcCain today. He's working hard and gaining strength.— Jeff Flake (@JeffFlake) February 10, 2018John McCain returned to Arizona in December, and has been doing physical therapy, though there has not been an official update on the senator's health in almost two months.
