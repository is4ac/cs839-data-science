We now have another piece of the puzzle folks. Just a few moments ago, the Directors Guild of America revealed their nominees. DGA doesn’t always match up with the Academy Awards lineup of Best Director, but it’s safe to assume that at least three or four of the honored individuals today will hear their names on Oscar nomination morning. DGA thankfully included plenty of diversity in their lineup this year, which also bode well for what AMPAS might do. Time will tell, but even a small step in the right direction is still very much a step in the right direction.
DGA actually went with my currently predicted Oscar five. That would be Guillermo del Toro for The Shape of Water, Greta Gerwig for Lady Bird, Martin McDonagh for Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, Christopher Nolan for Dunkirk, and Jordan Peel for Get Out. Not surprisingly, Peele was also one of the nominees in the First Time category, including writers turned directors Taylor Sheridan for Wind River and Aaron Sorkin for Molly’s Game. The Academy could very well go with these five, though obviously watch out for the snubbed Steven Spielberg for The Post, since you can never count him out. This Guild favors del Toro or Nolan, winner wise, but that’s a discussion for later. For the moment, on to the nominations…

Here now are the Directors Guild nominees in the theatrical categories:
