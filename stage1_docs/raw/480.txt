Salah set up Firmino for the opener just seven minutes in and the Egyptian winger grabbed his 22nd Premier League goal of the season shortly before half-time thanks to a clever assist from the Brazilian.
Southampton, who were up against their former defender Virgil van Dijk on his return to St Mary's, end the weekend in the relegation zone as their quest for a first home league win since November continues.
However, the result moves Liverpool to within two points of second-placed Manchester United who slipped to a 1-0 defeat away to Newcastle.
The Reds started brightly, needing no more than five minutes to open the scoring as Firmino collected Salah’s pass first time to finish off a rapid counter attack.
The Brazilian returned the favour to effectively end the game as a contest with a clever back-heel into the path of the Egyptian maestro to slot home.
After the break, Liverpool looked more likely to score  as they controlled possession, and only some last-ditch defending prevented a greater margin of victory.
