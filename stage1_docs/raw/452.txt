The Blues host West Brom on Monday evening as they look to end their recent slump, following back-to-back defeats to Bournemouth and Watford.
Their poor form has coincided with Morata’s absence, having missed five games with a back problem.
Conte said on Friday that he fears for his star striker’s fitness, saying he could be out for a ‘day, a month or the rest of the season’.
But, in a post on social media, Morata has insisted he is fine and fit to play against the Baggies.
Morata was forced to bizarrely hit back at critics, after a video of the 25-year-old dancing with his wife was posted on Instagram on Sunday night. Some fans questioned the legitimacy of his back issue after the video showed the striker lifting his wife as part of a dance routine.
Addressing the comments about his injury, he said: “It’s old video. I’m not injured. I’m OK for the game tomorrow. A lot of critics now, but no problem for me!"

Morata hasn't played for Chelsea since he was sent off in the 1-1 draw with Norwich in the FA Cup on January 17.
