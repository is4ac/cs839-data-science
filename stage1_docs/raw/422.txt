The Serie A champions have been hit by an injury crisis ahead of Tuesday's last-16 first-leg tie in Turin.
Dybala, Andrea Barzagli, Blaise Matuidi, Benedikt Howedes and Juan Cuadrado are all on the sidelines.
Juve boss Max Allegri had hoped to have Dybala available for the match. 
The striker, who has hit 17 goals this season, recently returned to training after a hamstring injury.
However, Dybala has failed to prove his match fitness and must now sit out the crunch Champions League tie.
