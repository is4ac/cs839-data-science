Ron WydenRonald (Ron) Lee Wyden   MORE (D-Ore.) requested any related documents or Suspicious Activity Reports the Treasury Department may have regarding the property, which Trump sold in 2008 to a Russian named Dmitry Rybolovlev.“In the context of the President’s then-precarious financial position, I believe that the Palm Beach property sale warrants further scrutiny,” Wyden wrote in the letter.“It is imperative that Congress follow the money and conduct a thorough investigation into any potential money laundering or other illicit financial dealings between the President, his associates, and Russia,” he wrote. The letter says Trump in 2004 bought the property for $41.35 million and sold it in 2008 to Rybolovlev for $95 million. Rybolovlev reportedly sold the property in parcels.Rybolovlev, according to CNN, was included on the Treasury Department's list of Russian oligarchs who have close ties to the Kremlin.Bloomberg reported last year that special counsel Robert MuellerRobert Swan Mueller MORE began probing Trump’s previous business dealings as part of the investigation into Russia's election meddling and any potential ties between Trump campaign staff members and the Kremlin.Wyden asked the Treasury Department to provide the committee with documents related to Rybolovlev's later sales by March 9.
