Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand    (D-N.Y.) and other Senate Democrats are jockeying for potential White House runs, but her unabashed style is drawing friendly fire that could hamper a 2020 bid.She scored an interview with CBS’s “60 Minutes” that aired on Sunday, which billed her as one of the “most prominent political faces of the #MeToo movement.”The high-profile media appearance, coupled with her public rebukes of former President Clinton and ex-Sen. Al Franken    (D-Minn.), has stirred some ill will among Senate Democrats — who sense a whiff of political opportunism.Her willingness to call out fellow Democrats has made her controversial within the Washington power establishment, which could be an asset on the campaign trail.Sunday’s “60 Minutes” piece described Gillibrand as a “lightning rod” for criticizing Clinton over his White House sex scandal and for leading the charge to push Franken out of Congress following multiple sexual harassment allegations.Some Democratic strategists predict Gillibrand’s statement last fall that Clinton should have resigned over the Monica Lewinsky affair will come back to haunt her.The comment caused so much agitation in Democratic circles that Allida Black, the co-founder of the Clinton super PAC Ready for Hillary who was married by Gillibrand, canceled a fundraiser for the senator.“She was disappointed with Gillibrand and going back and talking about all this stuff with Bill Clinton    after all this had been litigated,” one person familiar with the situation told The Hill. “But she also noticed people were upset and the money was drying up.”Even though the comments clearly miffed those in her party, Gillibrand hasn’t reached out to Clinton, according to a source familiar with the matter.When asked by “60 Minutes” whether she had contacted the Clintons, Gillibrand declined to comment.“I can tell you one thing: I can tell you that Hillary Clinton    is still my greatest role model in politics,” she demurred.Gillibrand’s allies argue that she has a long history of speaking out against sexual assault.They point out she took on a senior chairman from her own party, former Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl Levin    (D-Mich.), and former President Obama over the thorny issue of prosecuting sexual assaults in the military. Gillibrand wanted to remove prosecution decisions from the military chain of command, while Levin argued those decisions should be kept in the chain of command but reviewed by outside officers. The New York senator went so far as to draw Obama into the debate, calling on him to “show greater leadership” on the issue, arguing it fell directly within his authority.
