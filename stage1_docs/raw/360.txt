Matt Taylor scored the fourth goal of the game at Adams Park to make the score 2-2 just after the hour mark.
Adebayo Akinfenwa netted a winner for the hosts in the last minute, but Taylor's was the most memorable goal of the night.
That is because it was a stupendous free-kick that thundered into the far top corner of the net.
You can watch a video of the goal below...

Stuff #ValentinesDay, we’re just gonna watch this @Official_MattT free-kick over, and over again.
One to remember for @Official_STFC fans. pic.twitter.com/eiHmB2c7RY
