It’s now being reported, by the Daily Record, Pogba wants Mourinho to play a three-man midfield to better utilise his skillset.
But former Red Devils skipper Keane believes if he was truly a world class performer he would be able to showcase himself in the current formation.
He told ITV: "Any top player should be able to play in a two or a three. So the guy just needs to do better himself and focus on what the game of football’s all about.”
