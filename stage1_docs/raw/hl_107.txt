Hot on the heels of the precursor season launching yesterday, I have a brand new set of Academy Award predictions to share with you all. There are some definite changes to be seen, with the most noteworthy being that Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is really making a play towards the top of a lot of categories. Martin McDonagh’s film is quietly starting to seem like potentially the frontrunner in Best Picture. That’s just the buzz around town right now, buoyed by how amazing the movie actually is. How that’s handled is just one item on the docket today. Questions will soon be answered, and that’s pretty damn exciting folks.
Another thing you’ll likely notice is that I’ve moved The Post and Phantom Thread from predictions for now. They’re just outside of the nominated fields, at least until they either screen, confirm a 2017 release date, or just become less overt X factors. I’ve also removed The Current War completely, as The Weinstein Company pulled it from their calendar (also, the less said about them right now, the better). In addition, there’s the aforementioned surge for Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. That’s just a sample of what’s to come below. Take a look, of course, and just know that the changes will be coming hot and heavy now. The season is upon us…
