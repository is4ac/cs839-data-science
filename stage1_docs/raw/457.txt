Juventus v Tottenham is live on talkSPORT at 19:45 (GMT) on Tuesday 13 February
It is understood the defender, who has been sidelined for three months with a hamstring injury, has remained at home to work on his fitness.
However, Alderweireld's omission by Mauricio Pochettino for the trip to Turin - the Belgian was also absent from Totteanham's matchday squad against Arsenal - is likely to raise question marks over his future at White Hart Lane.
The 28-year-old defender is out of contract next summer, but Tottenham have an option to extend his deal by one season until 2020.
Failure to activate the extension however, will spark a release clause allowing Alderweireld to leave for a fee of £25.4million.
Alderweireld tore his hamstring in Tottenham's 3-1 Champions League group stage victory against Real Madrid on November 1.
He played 90 minutes in Spurs' Emirates FA Cup fourth-round replay victory against Newport at Wembley last week, and declared after the match he is fit and ready to play.
