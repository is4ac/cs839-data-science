The precursors are almost a daily occurrence now, so why not make new Academy Award predictions a weekly one too? That’s the goal here, as we enter the middle of December. The weather on the east coast is frigid, but the Oscar season is heating up, that’s for sure. The last X factors are revealing themselves (at least for me today, as I go see All the Money in the World and The Greatest Showman right after publishing this), so the guilds and precursors are separating things into contender and pretender categories. It’s almost all done. Yet, there’s still plenty to figure out.
Working off of the Golden Globe and Screen Actors Guild nominations, plus the announced short lists for Best Documentary Feature and Best Foreign Language Feature, among others, we have some changes here. Notably, Get Out has shot up in a number of categories, which even I’ll admit is a bit surprising. SAG is the one to pay heed to though, as the Best Picture winner almost always comes from their Best Cast Ensemble lineup. That potentially sets up a big battle between Lady Bird and Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, though that remains to be seen a bit. For now though, on to my picks…
