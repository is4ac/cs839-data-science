It’s the glamour game everyone is looking forward to, pitting the world’s best players against each other.
Two names in particular stand out on their respective Champions League team sheets; Cristiano Ronaldo and Neymar.
Last season, the former scored twice in the final to see off Juventus and seal a second successive win for Real Madrid in the competition. Neymar, meanwhile, moved to Paris in the summer in a world record £198million transfer, dwarfing the £80m Real paid for Ronaldo in 2009.
And ahead of the last 16 meeting, World Cup winner and Ballon d’Or winner Lothar Matthaus explained why he’d rather have Neymar in his side.
“Neymar is paid more money now and that will make Ronaldo angry,” he told The Sun. “He doesn’t like the fact he’s behind the Brazilian now and will want to give a performance that says ‘I’m the best and I’ve shown it.’
“But I think Neymar is more difficult to defend against. His movement is better and he has more tricks.”
