Highlights: Leicester City 1-0 Sheffield United

Lawro's prediction: 2-1Tekkerz Kid's prediction: This will be a tough game for Sheffield United. Leicester have Jamie Vardy and Riyad Mahrez and I can see those two just running past players, passing to each other and scoring. 2-0.Match reportChelsea 4-0 Hull

Highlights: Chelsea 4-0 Hull City

Lawro's prediction: 2-0Tekkerz Kid: Antonio Conte is going to be under big pressure. He cannot afford another loss and Chelsea fans will be disappointed if they don't go far in the FA Cup. Chelsea will put out a strong team, Eden Hazard will be on fire and Chelsea will get a comfortable win. 2-0.Match reportSATURDAYSheff Wed v Swansea (12:30 GMT)Championship (15th)vPremier League (16th)Who did they beat?4R: Reading (C)4R: Notts County (L2)3R: Carlisle (L2)3R: Wolves (C)

Highlights: Sheffield Wednesday 3-1 Reading

What a good job former Sheffield Wednesday boss Carlos Carvalhal has done since he went to Swansea. He has been fantastic, but this is a Sheffield Wednesday team who beat Derby 2-0 on Tuesday and I just wonder if they have turned the corner a bit. Lawro's prediction: 2-0Tekkerz Kid's prediction: 1-0

Brighton strengthened their squad in January and even though they will change their team they are on a good run a the moment and will want to keep it going.Coventry have had a great run and hopefully there will be a big crowd at Brighton and a big pay day for Coventry.

Football is just a bit mad sometimes and I am going to go for a West Brom win. They can't win a game at the moment but I'm tipping them for this one.

FA Cup: Yeovil Town 0-4 Manchester United highlights

Lawro's prediction: 1-2Tekkerz Kid's prediction: In the last round Huddersfield ended up winning comfortably at St Andrew's against Birmingham, and Manchester United did the same at Yeovil. I think there will be goals in this game. I don't think Manchester United can afford to have another loss so I think they will put out a strong team and win. I think Jesse Lingard will score one, Lukaku will score one and Alexis Sanchez will score two but I have no doubt Huddersfield will score. 2-4.SUNDAYRochdale v Tottenham (16:00 GMT)Rochdale got through to the fifth round by drawing at Millwall and then beating them at home on what looked like a beach. It is just something Tottenham will have to deal with. No doubt Mauricio Pochettino will change his team around after they played in the Champions League earlier this week.Keith Hill has been at Rochdale for a long, long time. They are not doing particularly well in the league but this will be a massive day for them. However, I think Tottenham, whatever team they select, will have too much for them.Lawro's prediction: 0-2League One (23rd)vPremier League (Fifth)Who did they beat?4R: Millwall (C)4R: Newport County (L2)3R: Doncaster (L1)3R: AFC Wimbledon (L1)2R: Slough (NL)1R: Bromley (NL)Tekkerz Kid's prediction: It is a League One team versus a Premier League team and I definitely think Spurs will win, especially if Harry Kane is playing. If he is playing he will just keep scoring against them. I think he will get at least two goals. 0-3MONDAYWigan v Man City (19:55 GMT)League One (Second)vPremier League (First)Who did they beat?4R: West Ham (PL)4R: Cardiff (C)3R: Bournemouth (PL)3R: Burnley (PL)2R: AFC Fylde (NL)1R: Crawley (L2)

FA Cup: Wigan 2-0 West Ham highlights

Wigan have knocked out two Premier League teams out on the way to the fifth round but this is completely different gravy. Manchester City played on Tuesday, they will be well rested but they will probably leave a couple of first-team players out just for insurance.I'm expecting a great atmosphere and a full house at Wigan, which is good for them, but you would argue both sides have bigger fish to fry. Wigan will want to get out of League One and promoted as champions.
