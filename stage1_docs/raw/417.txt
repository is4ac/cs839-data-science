Hazard’s importance to the London club was highlighted once again on Monday night, with the Belgian ace scoring twice as the Blues got back to winning ways with a 3-0 victory over West Brom.
The 27-year-old still has two years left to run on his current contract, but Chelsea are reportedly willing to make him one of the Premier League’s best-paid players if he pens a new long-term deal with the club.
However, no such deal has been struck yet and Spanish giants Real Madrid reportedly have a keen eye on the player ahead of the summer transfer window.
And Melchiot has warned his former club about the dangers of allowing their best player to leave, telling Chelsea to tie Hazard to a new and improved deal to ensure his long-term future at Stamford Bridge.
Speaking on the Alan Brazil Sports Breakfast, he said: “Hazard is back to his best. He is playing amazingly and was unbelievable against West Brom yesterday.
“Can they keep hold of him? It’s going to be a big loss if they let him go.
“If you let Hazard go, who else will want to come and play for Chelsea?
“He is their top player right now and top players attract top players.
“They have to do something to make sure they keep hold on him, so they can move forward and build, because Hazard is definitely key to this team right now.”
