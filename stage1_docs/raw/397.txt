The Brazilian goalkeeper is thought to be one of Liverpool's top targets this summer, with the jury still out on both Loris Karius and Simon Mignolet.
It has been suggested Alisson is being considered as a potential long-term number one for the Merseyside club following some impressive performances in Serie A.
But fellow European heavyweights PSG and Real Madrid are also monitoring his situation in the Italian capital closely ahead of the summer transfer window.
Roma, aware of the interest in the 25-year-old, are now working on a new deal for Alisson that would include a hefty release clause for any interested party.
The contract would also include a significant pay rise to keep him happy while ensuring that they would not have to sell unless a club coughed up £80m.
