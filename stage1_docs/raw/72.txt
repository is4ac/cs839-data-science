Paging Christy Carlson Romano, there’s a sitch! Disney is reviving Kim Possible for a live-action movie. The show, which began its original run in 2002 during Disney Channel’s golden era, followed a red-haired teen whose unconventional after-school job involved her saving the world from villains with her sidekick Ron Stoppable, his naked mole rat Rufus, and their techie friend Wade. Series creators Mark McCorkle and Robert Schooley will write the film, which has already begun casting. Allow us to assist: For Kim, might we suggest Riverdale’s fiery queen Madelaine Petsch (backups include Disney favorites Debby Ryan or Bella Thorne), former Nickelodeon star Nat Wolff for Ron, Spider-Man: Homecoming’s Jacob Batalon for Wade, Lindsay Lohan for Kim’s mom, and for Rufus, we give you this brilliant and correct Twitter recommendation: Pitbull. Booyah!
