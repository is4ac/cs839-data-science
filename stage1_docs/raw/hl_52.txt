It’s almost Christmas, which means, among other things, we’re almost out of movies for the year. Personally, I’ve seen all of the Oscar contenders by now, and in the coming days, audiences will be able to catch up. The Academy and its membership are doing the same, as the voting body begins to lock in on what the true contenders will be. Over the holiday, voters and their families will be watching screeners, and if you don’t think that has an impact on the race, you’re fooling yourself. These are actually crucial days now if you’re a film hoping to get nominated. As such, the waiting is now the hardest part.
Below is a look at how things stand currently. We had a few long lists come out to help clear races up a bit, notably in the Best Original Score, Best Original Song, and Best Visual Effects categories. Beyond that, there’s just the waiting game of how the still to come guilds will feel about certain films. I’m currently sticking with Lady Bird in the top spot, Best Picture wise, and I really do think that it will benefit on Oscar’s preferential ballot. Time will tell, but at the moment, what I have below really does look right to me, by and large. Take a gander next and see for yourself…
