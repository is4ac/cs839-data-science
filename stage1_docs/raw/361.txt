Seemingly every week the prolific Tottenham striker reaches a new landmark.
On Tuesday night against Juventus, he breached one of the strongest defences in Europe to make yet more history and claim his 33rd goal of an incredible campaign.
Check out the some of the amazing records set by the Spurs star this season:
December 2017: 
- Kane became the first player in Premier League history to score consecutive hat-tricks on two separate occasions
- Kane hit his 39th Premier League goal in 2017 to surpass Alan Shearer's record for top-flight goals in a calendar year
- Kane became the first player in Premier League history to score six hat-tricks in a calendar year
- Kane became the first Englishman to score 50 goals or more in a single calendar year for both club and country since Dixie Dean in 1927
- Kane ended the year with more goals for club and country than other player in Europe's top five leagues in 2017 (56 in 52 games)
January 2018:
- Kane replaced Teddy Sheringham as Tottenham's record Premier League goalscorer when he hit his 98th goal for the club
February 2018:
- Kane became the first player to score 100 goals for Spurs in the Premier League when he netted against Liverpool
- Kane equalled the record for the most goals scored by an English player in a single Champions League season with goal against Juventus
- Kane became the first player to score nine goals in his first nine Champions League appearances with goal against Juventus

With three months still left of the season, Kane could yet achieve more milestones.
Here's the records the 24-year-old will have his sights on:
- Breaking Alan Shearer and Andy Cole's shared record of 31 goals in a 38-game Premier League season. (Kane has 23 goals with 11 matches left to play).
- Surpassing Steven Gerrard as the English with the most goals in a single Champions League season
- Becoming the first striker since Alan Shearer to win the Premier League's Golden Boot for three successive seasons
