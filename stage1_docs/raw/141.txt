Majority Leader Mitch McConnell    (R-Ky.) teed up votes on a slate of immigration proposals on Wednesday, as he tries to break a logjam that has held the chamber's debate in a days-long limbo. McConnell filed cloture on four amendments: A proposal from Sens. John McCain    (R-Ariz.) and Christopher Coons    (D-Del.) that deals with "Dreamers" and border security; a measure from Sen. Pat Toomey    (R-Pa.) cracking down on "sanctuary cities"; a bipartisan immigration deal spearheaded by GOP Sen. Susan Collins    (Maine); and a GOP-only bill that mirrors President Trump   's framework.  Under the chamber's rules, the Senate could hold a procedural vote as soon as Friday morning unless they can get a deal to speed up their debate.  To overcome the initial hurdle, a proposal will need to get 60 votes — meaning it will need the support of both Republicans and Democrats. If an amendment fails to meet the supermajority threshold, senators are expected to move directly to an initial vote on the next amendment.  The floor action comes as the Senate's immigration debate has largely stalemated, with Democrats blocking McConnell from scheduling votes on Tuesday and uncertainty swirling about if any proposal will be able to pass the chamber this week.  Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer    (D-N.Y.) said on Wednesday evening that the chamber is "closer than we have ever been" to passing a bill to help the Dreamers.
