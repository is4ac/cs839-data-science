Last night, the critics portion of the precursor season came to a head with the 23rd annual Critics’ Choice Awards. Chosen by the Broadcast Film Critics Association, the winners here get a nice little boost as Academy Award voting is currently wrapping up. Remember, critics aren’t members of the Academy, so there’s limited impact to be found for Oscar, but televised victories are never a bad thing. Wins here are fuel for nominations, and little more. Still, forward momentum is useful and appreciated, to say the least. For a few movies, it was a great evening, with one Guillermo del Toro helmed picture doing particularly well.
The BFCA went wild (comparatively) for The Shape of Water, which led the field with four wins, to go along with entering the night as the overall nominations leader. Other multi winners were Coco, Darkest Hour, Get Out, I, Tonya, and Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. The love was spread out otherwise, giving almost every film nominated a win. There were even upsets, as The Big Sick was a great surprise, taking the Best Comedy prize. You’ll be able to see the full results next, but just keep in mind that voting is about to close, so the nominees for the Oscars are literally being decided as you read this…
