Moyes was given a six-month contract when he replaced Slaven Bilic as manager in November, and was tasked with keeping the club in the Premier League after a dreadful start.
The Hammers were 18th in the table when he took over after claiming just nine points from 11 games. After beating Watford 2-0 on Saturday the side are now up to 12th place, five points above the relegation zone and one behind tenth-placed Bournemouth.
However, having previously gone four games without a win, including an FA Cup exit to League One side Wigan, it was claimed West Ham bosses were expected to axe Moyes at in the summer and search for a new permanent appointment.
Those rumours appeared to be shut down by co-owner David Sullivan, who said before kick-off that he hoped the Scot would stay as the club's manager for "many years".

And asked about the speculation over his future, and those reports by the Daily Telegraph, Moyes told the Alan Brazil Sports Breakfast: “No, that’s definitely not the case.
“The situation when I came in was that I said I wouldn’t make any decision until the end of the season, and I didn’t want West Ham to make a decision either.
“I said, ‘let’s see how it goes’, because first and foremost we have to make sure we’re a Premier League club
“I was happy doing that, I came in on a short-term contract, I had no problem with that and that’s the way I want it to remain.
“Anything what has been said is completely wrong – we’ll decide at the end of the season.
“The job I want to do is to make sure West Ham are a Premier League club, and I want to see what West Ham can do in the future. This club has big expectations, they are pulling in nearly 60,000 people every game and I think it can get bigger and better.”
