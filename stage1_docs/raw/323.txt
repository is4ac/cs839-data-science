Both Premier League clubs are interested in the Slovakian defender, who has impressed since joining Inter from Sampdoria in the summer.
An interview with Slovakian newspaper Sport this month put City and United on red alert, after he name-checked both clubs and described the Premier League as the most beautiful in the world.
He also claimed that an incredible offer had been made for him in January but he decided to stay at Inter until at least the summer.
But now Skriniar has denied that he ever said those things and is adamant that he was misquoted somewhere along the line.
“I never thought or said that I wanted to leave Inter,” Skriniar wrote on Instagram.
“It is an honour for me to be here! I don’t know who translated the words from Slovakian, but they didn’t do it very well.”
