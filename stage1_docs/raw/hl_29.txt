Folks, it all comes down to this. The time for talk is over. The Academy Award nominations will be announced tomorrow morning. Over the weekend, two of the most important precursors chimed in, albeit with Oscar voting already closed. The Producers Guild of America and the Screen Actors Guild gave us some potential information, though more perhaps having to do with our ultimate winners. The guilds have made a case for certain films, while others are hoping that Academy voters through them a bone in less than 24 hours. Oscar is about to have their say. As such, don’t expect any major changes since last week. What’s done is done. Now, we wait…
Below you will see my final Academy Award predictions. Yes, it’s last call. This comes hot on the heels of the PGA prize going to The Shape of Water (along with Coco for Animation and Jane for Documentary) on Saturday, with yesterday evening SAG crowning the front-running quartet of Gary Oldman (for Darkest Hour), Frances McDormand (for Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri), Sam Rockwell (also for Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri), and Allison Janney (for I, Tonya). Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri also took Best Ensemble, their version of Best Picture. As such, The Shape of Water looks set to duke it out with Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri for the Academy’s top prize, with Get Out and especially Lady Bird lurking in the shadows and hoping to sneak up the middle in the end. For now, take a look at the predictions and come back tomorrow for the results of the big morning.
