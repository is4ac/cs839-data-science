As usual, Tom Hardy is playing a movie character with a troubled past. In Sony’s Venom, Hardy chooses an exciting new accent, climbs onto a motorcycle, and breaks down under the strain of some intense trauma. Venom’s a classic Spider-Man villain slash anti-hero, who gets his powers thanks to some nasty alien symbiote that Riz Ahmed’s character seems to be studying. Michelle Williams is also there in the sad–Michelle Williams–ex role. Venom premieres this October, expect sadness and lots of rain.
