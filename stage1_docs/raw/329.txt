Manchester City’s dominance in the Premier League has put pressure on manager Jose Mourinho and now Pobga’s dip in form is also increasing scrutiny on the club.
Mourinho dropped the 24-year-old against Huddersfield recently, but another poor showing against Newcastle saw him substituted after 66 minutes last weekend.
The pair were also seen in a heated debate during the 2-0 defeat to Tottenham Hotspur at Wembley and it appears Pogba now wants a more attacking role in the side, having been forced to defend more in a central pairing with Nemanja Matic.
And reports in L’Equipe now suggest the £89.3m man has some regrets over his decision to return to the Premier League, while it also states the player had never hidden his initial attraction to Real Madrid’s overtures.
