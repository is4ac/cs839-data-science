The 24-year-old assured Potters fansâ€™ on Twitter he had not asked for a transfer, promising to fight to secure the club's top-flight future.
"Before this spreads any further, I haven't told the club I want to leave, I'm focused on doing everything I can to keep the club in this division!" Butland posted on social media.
Stoke have dropped into the relegation zone after just one win in eight Premier League encounters, but Butland insists new manager Paul Lambert has the squad redoubling their efforts in training.
"I'm really pleased with the improvement in performances recently and we are finally feeling as though we are in games and could be picking up points," Butland told Stoke's official website.
Butland joined Stoke from Birmingham in 2013, and is expected to make the England squad for the summer's World Cup in Russia.
