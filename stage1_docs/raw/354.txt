The 18-year-old forward has netted six goals in 19 appearances in the Eredivisie this season and his excellent performances have seen him linked with some of Europe's biggest clubs.
Kluivert Jr. recently alerted four of England's top sides, after admitting he could see himself playing for Arsenal, Tottenham, Chelsea or Manchester United.
Barcelona and Real Madrid are also reportedly keen on him, and a bidding war for the starlet is expected when the summer transfer window opens.
However, his father Patrick has advised his son to remain at Ajax for the time being before making a multi-million pound switch to one of Europe's top clubs, just as he did did in the 90s.
Speaking to Cadena Ser, Kluivert - who won the Champions League with Ajax before playing for the likes of AC Milan and Barcelona - said: “Justin is doing very well, and must keep going like this.
“He must keep his feet on the ground. I've told him that he is still 18 and should be relaxed and for sure stay another year or more at Ajax.
“When you go to another country, another competition, you must be strong mentally and physically, you should not leave too early.”
