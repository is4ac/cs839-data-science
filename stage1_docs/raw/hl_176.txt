Earlier today, the 2017 Toronto International Film Festival unveiled its lineup, bringing to the forefront a number of potential Academy Award contenders for this year. Toronto often launches a fair amount of awards players into the mix, so the expectation is that the same will be the case here. TIFF has quite the slate planned, with more to come, as this was just the first wave. Everything announced so far will be at the end of this piece, but first I do want to call out some of the possible prestige projects already set for the fest. From there, we’ll move on to the complete list.
You’ll see the lineup below, but first, a quick mention of some of the potentially Oscar friendly titles in the mix. They include Battle of the Sexes from Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris, BPM (Beats Per Minute) from Robin Campillo, Call Me By Your Name from Luca Guadagnino, The Current War from Alfonso Gomez-Rejon, Darkest Hour from Joe Wright, Downsizing from Alexander Payne, First They Killed My Father from Angelina Jolie, Hostiles from Scott Cooper, I, Tonya from Craig Gillespie, Lady Bird from Greta Gerwig, mother! from Darren Aronofsky, The Mountain Between Us from Hany Abu-Assad, Mudbound from Dee Rees, The Shape of Water from Guillermo del Toro, The Square from Ruben Östlund, Stronger from David Gordon Green, Suburbicon from George Clooney, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri from Martin McDonagh, as well as Victoria and Abdul from Stephen Frears. That’s just a small sample of what will be playing up north this fall..
