This morning, the American Cinema Editors announced their nominees for 68th annual ACE Eddie Awards. This is one of the most important guilds to take notice of, due to how Best Film Editing at the Academy Awards can often link up to Best Picture. It’s not a perfect correlation, but when looking for hints as to what voters might do, anything helps. Here, they’ve nominated almost all of the likely Best Picture nominees, so that’s a help. In fact, outside of Baby Driver and Molly’s Game, I’d say the other eight contenders here are among the favorites to make the big lineup. Time will tell, of course, but ACE is working from a list of frontrunners this year, that’s for sure.
Below you can see the nominees for the ACE Eddie. Last year, the big winners were Arrival and La La Land, though Hacksaw Ridge wound up taking the Oscar in Best Film Editing. This year, it’s a wide open race, so any of the films cited by ACE. The Dramatic category seems to favor Dunkirk and editor Lee Smith, though watch out for Blade Runner 2049, as Joe Walker is a previous winner here. As for Comedic, it could literally go to any of the five nominees, though I, Tonya might very well play spoiler. In the Animated field, it seems like Coco has it in the bag. We shall see though…
