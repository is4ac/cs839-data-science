Harry Kane’s second-half header sealed a 1-0 victory and helped move Spurs seven points clear of their rivals in the Premier League table, and gave the hosts a huge boost in their quest for a top four finish.

Arsenal, meanwhile, could be eight points off the top four, and a return to the Champions League, if results go against them over the weekend.
And Pochettino believes taking positive results from a string of such high-profile matches can only be good for his players' confidence as they look to secure a top-four finish of their own.
"I think it is important for the belief of the team," the Spurs boss said.
"You know very well that football is about trust, confidence and belief. I think a clean sheet against United, clean sheet against Arsenal and I think we deserved more against Liverpool but only took a draw.
"The performance of the team is fantastic, I'm so pleased because that was a key period where you need to fight for the top four and with these three points we are in the battle and arriving in the Champions League is a competition that excites the fans, excites us and you dream of playing in those games."
