This story contains spoilers for all of The Last Jedi.In the days before The Last Jedi opened in theaters, three Star Wars fans who go by Rosie, Ricca, and Trebia started receiving messages online from people who’d seen the film early. The gist, as Rosie described it: “How does it feel to have your fan fiction turned into a movie?”Rosie, 28, and Ricca, 29, are the authors of Interstellar Transmissions, which on the leading fan-fiction site Archive of Our Own is the most widely read story inspired by Star Wars’s Episode VII, The Force Awakens. Trebia, 26, is the author of Forms, another popular piece of fan fiction crafted immediately after Disney’s 2015 franchise reboot. Both stories focus on the scrappy scavenger Rey and the villainous Skywalker heir Kylo Ren discovering they share a telepathic bond across the galaxy, and then teaming up to defeat Supreme Leader Snoke.Sound familiar? The Last Jedi has the saga’s rising “good guy”—or girl, in this case—supernaturally backchanneling with its rising bad guy. Rey and Kylo build some sort of trust, and then Kylo betrays his boss, Snoke, as she hoped he would. The fact that well-read fan writers and Disney’s professional writers came up with such similar stories is, among other things, a testament to the ways Rey and Kylo Ren represent something fundamental—as well as vitally new—about Star Wars.
