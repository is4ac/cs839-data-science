The Blues have lost their last two games and lie fifth in the Premier League table, with speculation surrounding manager Antonio Conte's future at the helm gathering momentum. 
Their opponents have their own form to worry about, however. West Brom are rooted to the bottom of the table and are seven points away from safety. 
Chelsea midfielder Tiemoue Bakayoko is unavailable for selection after picking up a red card in Chelsea's abysmal 4-1 defeat at Watford last time around.
