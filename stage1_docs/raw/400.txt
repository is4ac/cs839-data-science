The defender’s current deal is due to expire in the summer and he has been in talks over fresh terms for months.
The Premier League trio are all monitoring the situation closely and are ready to pounce if the Dutchman becomes available for free.
De Vrij, however, is leaning towards signing a new deal and then leaving for around £20million due to a release clause that would be inserted in the contract.
The 26-year-old wants to thank Lazio for the support they have given him, particularly when he was out through injury, and he wants to ensure they get a fee for him.
But, according to La Repubblica, De Vrij’s agent is holding up the progress of talks with his demands.
The centre-back’s representative is demanding that he receives 20 per cent of any future transfer fee.
Lazio are strongly against such terms and talks are said to be on the brink of collapsing.
