Aubameyang, a £55 million signing from Borussia Dortmund last month, is unavailable for Thursday’s clash in Sweden because the Gunners could face his former side in the later rounds.
However Henrikh Mkhitaryan, a January signing from Manchester United, is available to play because United are still in Europe’s elite competition.
Wenger, who is also without Alexandre Lacazette who is struggling with a knee injury, believes the rule is antiquated and needs updating.
Asked if Aubameyang's absence was caused by an old-fashioned rule, Wenger replied: "Yes. Unanimously, I believe that all the clubs agree now this rule has to disappear in Europe.
"Especially because, for example, he played Dortmund, Dortmund has been reversed in the Europa League and he cannot play.
"When you look at the transfer amounts you spend now, that you have to spend £50, 60, 70million in the middle of the season, that the players cannot play doesn't make sense.
“Unanimously everywhere in Europe now the clubs are against this rule."
Ostersunds only came into existence a month after Wenger was appointed as Arsenal manager in October 1996, although the Frenchman is not taking the Swedish side lightly.
