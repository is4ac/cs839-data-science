The Belgium international has made just 16 appearances for United this season and is set to leave Old Trafford to secure regular first-team football elsewhere.
A potential move to Italy has been touted, while clubs in Spain are also said to be monitoring the 30-year-old's future closely.
However, according to Fotomac, Fellaini will move to Turkish Super League giants Besiktas for free at the end of the season.
Fellaini is likely to be included in Belgium's World Cup squad and he is then expected to move to Turkey to link up with his new team-mates.
