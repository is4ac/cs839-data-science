As the weather gets hotter and hotter, thoughts of the Academy Awards begin percolating in my mind. It’s always there, of course, but now, officially in the second half of the year, it feels time to get down to business, as it were. Summer counter programming is out and hoping to catch the eye of voters as they enjoy the months before they get down to awards season business. All this is to say that predictions are in flux. There are always differences from month to month, but from here on out, there could be more than usual. That’s just the name of the game.
As you’ll see below, there’s some definite movement in my predictions. The big question mark for me right now is Christopher Nolan’s Dunkirk. Some have actually seen it, but no full reviews are out yet. That leads you to wonder where it stands in the Oscar race. At the very least, it’ll be a technical player, going by the bits of praise that have been allowed out into the world. Beyond that, we don’t know yet. The Academy will surely see it either way, but in my mind, it’s a real X factor. As such, I’ve moved it down some rankings, at least until I lay eyes on it in a couple of days. Pair that with Darkest Hour getting a Trailer yesterday and the World War II epics are starting to make their cases. Anyway, on to the update…
