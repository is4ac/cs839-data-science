That's according his agent, Jonathan Barnett, who has poured cold water on the Welsh superstar leaving the Spanish giants.
Bale has been linked with a move to Manchester United in recent months, while a shock return to Tottenham has been touted too.
However, Barnett is adamant that Bale is not looking to leave Madrid, after ending his injury nightmare in the Spanish capital.
The 28-year-old sat out 14 games towards the end of 2017 but has enjoyed a successful return since the turn of the year.
Bale has started 2018 on top form and was voted Real's Player of the Month for January after scoring five goals.
And Barnett believes his client is now worth the same as Neymar – who left Barcelona to join Paris Saint-Germain in a world-record £200million move last summer.
Speaking to Italian newspaper Tuttosport, Bale's agent said: "He loves Real Madrid and doesn't want to leave.
"Gareth does not need [Cristiano] Ronaldo to leave Real Madrid, he is already a top star of the club.
"I think he's worth as much as Neymar."
