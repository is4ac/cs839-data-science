Now that the Academy has had their say, it’s time to figure out just who and what might be winning Academy Awards in March. The next month and change will be relatively quiet, with only a few precursors (mainly the Directors Guild) chiming in with their clues. As such, a lot could ride on just how voters feel in this down time. Will they reconsider any of their choices? That remains to be seen, though most of the power players stayed the same. If anything, it was lower tier nominees moving towards the middle, which shouldn’t actually impact much. Still, there’s plenty to consider.
Below are an initial set of predictions for the ceremony. A lot of things seem to be more or less what we thought going into the nominations. One change is that The Shape of Water has moved into the lead for Best Picture. The lack of a Best Director nomination probably keeps Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri from winning Best Picture, which is why I’ve dropped it down so low. Get Out and Lady Bird both have no below the line nominations, which hurts, so while they still have a chance, it doesn’t look quite as good as before. Frankly, while it almost certainly won’t win, Dunkirk seems like it could pose the real challenge. If so, look for Guillermo del Toro’s fantasy romance to walk away with a number of Academy Awards, including the big one.
