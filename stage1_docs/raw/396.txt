Chris Smalling and Phil Jones' places are reportedly under threat, with Real Madrid's Raphael Varane, Tottenham's Toby Alderweireld and Leicester's Harry Maguire all linked.
Alderweireld, regarded as one of the best in Europe, could be cheap for a club like United. His contract expires in 2019, but includes a one-year extension, which is scheduled to be activated next summer. However, it features a £25million release clause which could be activated in the summer of 2019 and increases the pressure on Spurs to sell when the next transfer window opens.
A midfielder is also believed to be on the agenda and a lot of talk has focused on the position of Pogba - do they need someone else to play next to him?
Ryan Giggs thinks he plays best in a 4-3-3 system "with Matic sitting, [Ander] Herrera to the right and Pogba to the left, with a selection of the front three thriving off more creativity behind them.
"One of the best games Pogba had was the Everton game [2-0 win on 1 January], when he was on the left of Matic - in a similar position to the one he played at Juventus - and Herrera was on the right.
"I think that position where he's on the left of a midfield three is where he's at his best. He's a brilliant crosser of the ball and I don't think he's as effective when he's having to do more defensive work in central areas."
Mourinho was recently asked what the player's best position is and made his view quite clear.
"It depends on the tactical system the team plays - he can play with two, he can play with one, he can play with three [midfielders] but he will always be a midfield player," he explained. "It doesn't matter the tactical system the team plays - for me, Pogba is a midfield player," adding the France international "has everything".
A winger is another area of the pitch the club are thought to be keen on strengthening.
