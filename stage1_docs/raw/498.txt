The Manchester United manager's touchline histrionics have been well documented over the years, leading the Portuguese to regularly clash with football's authorities.
But Mourinho is making a focused effort to change tack at a time of refereeing scrutiny, such as Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp's anger towards officials after last weekend's frenetic 2-2 draw with Tottenham.
"I am fully committed to win the award this season of the best-behaved manager on the touchline," Mourinho said. "I am serious!
"There are so many awards - performance of the week, manager of the month and this and that - they should give one (to) the guy that behaves best on the touchline and it should be the fourth official to vote.
"I'm pretty sure that I would win. I'm serious! I didn't create one problem to one fourth official on a touchline, apart from my red card at Southampton when I put a foot on the pitch.
"I'm serious, I prepare myself, I'm really happy. I'm not free of losing my temper, my control in one match. I'm not perfect.
"I'm not going from the Bad One to the Perfect One, no way, but I try, I make an effort and I'm happy with the way things are going."
