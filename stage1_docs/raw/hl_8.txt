Yesterday afternoon, the British Academy more or less set the stage for Oscar, as the BAFTA awards were given out. With that final precursor, voting for the Academy Awards will begin tomorrow, and that’s where decisions will actually be made. Academy members will have BAFTA results in their back pocket, and they could loom large. If so, that may be a very good sign for Martin McDonagh’s Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. The British voters had a number of hometown favorites to choose from, and went with that one, instead of contenders like Christopher Nolan’s Dunkirk (a bit surprisingly, though I had predicted it to come up just short) and Joe Wright’s Darkest Hour.
Below you will be able to see what BAFTA did in full, but they clearly were big fans of Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. It took home five prizes, including the top one of Best Film. Essentially, the major prizes all went to the expected Oscar winners (if we assume that Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is the Academy frontrunner in Best Picture), with the possible exception of Original Screenplay. That was one of the spots where Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri and McDonagh showed added strength. If ever there was a time for this movie to come on strong, it’s now. As voters go to the polls, as it were, it’s surging. More on that in a minute, but first…the results!

So, where do we stand now with Oscar? Essentially, the acting categories and Best Adapted Screenplay seem sewn up, with the same going for Best Director. The major categories still in flux are Best Picture and Best Original Screenplay. There, it does seem like Get Out and Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri are fighting to win both. Picture also has Dunkirk, Lady Bird, and The Shape of Water still looking to pull the upset, though those seem less likely. Dunkirk and The Shape of Water have a chance, but it does appear that Lady Bird is poised to somehow go home empty handed. We’ll be discussing this all soon, but just keep it all in mind as we reach the literal 11th hour in the awards season…

Stay tuned to see if Oscar will follow along or do their own thing next month!
