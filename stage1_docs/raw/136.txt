In April of 1999, 51 percent of voters approved of the job Schumer was doing at the time, while 22 percent did not approve."Proof perhaps that even one the most popular of Senators can get muddied up in today's Washington swamp," Quinnipiac University Poll assistant director Tim Malloy said in a statement."Sen. Chuck Schumer    gets the worst approval rating he's seen in nearly 20 years."The poll comes as both parties try to blame each other for two government shutdowns in a month’s time.It also comes as lawmakers struggle to reach a deal over immigration, including a legislative fix for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which shields young immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally as children from deportation.Schumer was elected to his fourth term in the Senate in 2016.
