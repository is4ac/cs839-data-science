Gonzalo Higuain was left unmarked in the box from a free-kick to score a fantastic volley inside two minutes.
Clearly on the ropes, Spurs conceded again when Ben Davies clipped Bernadeschi in the box to allow Higuain the chance to score form 12 yards.

The comeback was complete in the second half when more Tottenham pressure told and the insatiable Christian Eriksen rattled a free-kick past Buffon to leave the tie finely poised for the return leg at Wembley.
So how did the Spurs players get on?
