That’s according to The Sun’s chief sports writer Dave Kidd, who claims Mourinho is now devoid of the spark he originally had when he burst onto the scene with his eccentric touchline celebration at Old Trafford in 2004.
The Portuguese has a playing squad worth a combined £660.8 million at his disposal, but has struggled to seriously trouble runaway leaders Manchester City, who sit a comfortable 16 points ahead of them.
Kidd describes United as the ‘English Galacticos’ who apparently favour ‘celebrity over silverware’ for their celebration of Alexis Sanchez and Paul Pogba selling a record number of shirts in the Premier League.
Such fascination on commercial gains has seen them slip to mediocre standards behind the sensational Manchester City, with Kidd singling out Mourinho for the Red Devils’ failure.
Where the ex-Chelsea boss once turned ordinary Porto players into Champions League winners, he is now proving to be detrimental to the careers of United’s superstars.
