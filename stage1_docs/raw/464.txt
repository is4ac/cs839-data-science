Fernando Llorente says he misses Juventus ‘like crazy’ and admitted he cried when his time at the club ended.
Llorente played for the Italian champions between 2013 and 2015, scoring 27 goals in 92 games in all competitons. He won two league titles and an Italian Cup during this time in Turin and also played in a Champions League final.

He joined Tottenham from Swansea in the summer and meets his former club in the first leg of their Champions League last 16 clash on Tuesday.
“Juve is a difficult place to leave,” he told Italian newspaper Tuttosport. “I left the Vinovo training ground crying. It’s also true what David Trezeguet said: 'It’s only when you leave Juventus that you realise what you had.'
“I miss it like crazy and would love to return. It’s a special club because, despite being an enormous club, it’s like a family inside.”
And Llorente, 32, is clearly looking forward to returning to Turin where many of his former team-mates still play.
“It’ll be a wonderful sensation. I experienced unforgettable moments, won five titles, reached a Champions League final. All the fans continue to show me great affection via social media. They make me feel as if I was there for 10 years rather than two.”
