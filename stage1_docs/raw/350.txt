The 25-year-old is out of contract at the end of the season and is ready to leave in search of a fresh challenge.
And, according to Turkish newspaper Aksam, Arsenal are the ones fighting hardest to sign the midfielder.
The Gunners reportedly failed with a £6.2m move for Ozyakup in January so they are now ready to sign him for free.
The Turkey international spent much of his youth career with the north London club before joining Besiktas in 2012 for around £500,000.
Since leaving north London, Ozyakup has developed into a regular for club and country and Arsene Wenger now wants to bring him back to the Emirates.
