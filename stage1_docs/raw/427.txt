Their three goals were followed by chants of support from the club's fans for Conte, and the 48-year-old said: "I have to thank the fans. They showed me great support because they are reading speculation and rumours about me. I'm grateful to the fans for supporting me in this way.
"It means that, maybe in our 18 months together, they understand my passion and my will to defend these colours, this shirt, this badge.
"To feel this atmosphere around me is very important. It's very important to feel that people appreciate my work here in Chelsea. For me it's important.
"I repeat: me and the players are trying to do our best to give them the best satisfaction. Sometimes we can do this, sometimes not, but the will is always present."
