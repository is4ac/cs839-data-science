Another day, another report from the precursor scene. Yes, today marks another notable point in Phase One of the season, as the New York Film Critics Circle is chiming in with their winners for 2017. Not only that, yesterday has the nominees announced for the 22nd annual Satellite Awards. We’re still early on in this point, but some contenders for Oscar attention are starting to get wins under their belts. Over the next few weeks, a glut of critics awards will start to give some films and performances a leg up in the race. Of course, until the Guilds chime in, no movie, no actor, no actress, and no filmmaker is truly out of it.
As you’ll see, NYFCC had their victors, which is always a prestigious bunch, while the Satellite nominations more or less included all the big contenders. For the latter, Dunkirk led with a strong 11 nods, while The Shape of Water also had double digit noms, pulling in ten. Also doing well were Lady Bird and Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri with six each, while the lot of Blade Runner 2049, Darkest Hour, Get Out, and War for the Planet of Apes all got a quartet of citations. As for the former, it went for Lady Bird with their top prize. That film, as well as The Florida Project, took home two prizes, making it a good day for A24.
