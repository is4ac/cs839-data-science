MATCH REPORT - Juventus 2-2 Tottenham: Christian Eriksen the star as Spurs stun Old Lady in Champions League thriller in Turin
Juventus are considered one of the toughest sides to break down in the whole of Europe, but Spurs were the team on top for large periods of the game and have a great chance of progressing to the quarter-finals ahead of the second leg at Wembley.
The last time Tottenham made the last eight in the competition was back in 2011 under Harry Redknapp, when a Gareth Bale-inspired team was beaten by Real Madrid.
But Ginola insists Tuesday’s draw in Turin proves Spurs are not there just to make up the numbers this season and that they can compete with Europe’s elite.
Speaking on the Alan Brazil Sports Breakfast, the former White Hart Lane hero said: “Could Tottenham win the Champions League? Why not?
“They are in the competition, and they showed last night that they are capable of doing something.
“They have the potential. They have striker who can score goals, they’ve got a great goalkeeper, a great manager and overall the team and the shape are good.
“Anything is possible with Spurs.
“But there are so many great teams in this competition - Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain and Liverpool are great as well.
“This year is a very open competition, to say who will win the Champions League this season is very hard to say.”
