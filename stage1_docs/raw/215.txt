Bernie Sanders    (I-Vt.) will head to Iowa this month to campaign with a former presidential campaign aide who is running for Congress. Sanders will headline a Feb. 23 event in Des Moines for Iowa's 3rd District Democratic candidate Pete D’Alessandro, who worked as his adviser during the Iowa caucus in 2016.“Bernie knows that we need bold, progressive leaders in Congress if we’re going to change the direction of our country,” D’Alessandro said in a statement to the Des Moines Register.“That’s why I’m proudly supporting Medicare for All, a $15/hour living wage, and free college tuition for those who work hard. We can take our country back and continue the movement Bernie started here in 2016," he continued. The visit marks Sanders's first trip to Iowa this year and is likely to spark speculation about a potential 2020 presidential run. Sanders narrowly lost the state's caucus to eventual Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton    in 2016.  He is considered part of a large field of potential Democratic candidates to challenge President Trump   , including former Vice President Joe Biden   , former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, and Sens. Kamala Harris    (Calif.), Cory Booker    (N.J.) and Elizabeth Warren    (Mass.).
