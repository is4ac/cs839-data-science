After the intensity of waiting for the Academy Award nominations, it’s time for something a little bit fun today. As we wait for ballots to go out to Academy members and final Oscar voting to get underway (which will still be a little ways away), why not play around with a hypothetical situation? Now is the time to do it, after all. This is something I’ve done from time to time in the past, which is to look at what the Oscar nominations could have looked like if you remove all of the actual nominees. Weird, I know, but hey, it’s fun. Plus, it’s certainly more apt than ever to do this in our seemingly permenant era of “alternative facts”, isn’t it? This isn’t a political post at all, but I couldn’t resist another little dig at Donald Trump and his cronies. No, this is just a different way of seeing who and what the snubs yesterday were.
Below you will be able to see what these alternate Academy Award nominations could have been. In some categories, it’s easy to speculate, like with Best Picture and how films like The Big Sick and I, Tonya were probably next in line. Or, you can look at Best Director and be reasonably confident that Martin McDonagh was next in line for Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. In terms of Acting categories, James Franco for The Disaster Artist and Holly Hunter for The Big Sick were near misses, with the same going for Tom Hanks too, snubbed for The Post. These are just my guesses though, so keep that in mind. Now, on to the fun…
