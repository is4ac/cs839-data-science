The 48-year-old, out of work since his sacking by Sunderland last October, succeeds Stuart McCall at Valley Parade.
A Bradford statement published on their official website read: "Grayson has been our number-one target to take over first-team affairs since the search began earlier this week."
McCall was sacked following a run of six consecutive defeats in all competitions, but Grayson will take over a side who are still occupying the League One play-off positions.
He will meet the players on Monday and will be in charge for the Bantams trip to Charlton Athletic on Tuesday.
Grayson was reportedly interested in returning to former club Leeds United, but the post was filled by ex-Barnsley boss Paul Heckingbottom.
