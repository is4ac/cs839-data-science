Tim Kaine    (D-Va.) tore into President Trump    for his comments defending former White House staff secretary Rob Porter, saying there’s a “complete moral vacuum in the Oval Office” with the president praising an accused domestic abuser.“Domestic violence is evil, and there aren't 'both sides' on this issue. Real leaders stand with survivors, not perpetrators,” Kaine, the 2016 Democratic vice presidential nominee, tweeted.What's "sad" is having a complete moral vacuum in the Oval Office. Domestic violence is evil, and there aren't "both sides" on this issue. Real leaders stand with survivors, not perpetrators.— Tim Kaine (@timkaine) February 9, 2018Kaine was referring to Trump's comments last year after the deadly white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va., in which he said there was “blame on both sides."Trump earlier Friday spoke out in defense of Porter, who resigned from the White House on Wednesday over allegations of domestic abuse."I found out about it very recently and I was surprised by it. But we certainly wish him well, obviously a tough time for him," the president told reporters. "He did a very good job when he was in the White House and we hope he has a wonderful, hopefully, he has a great career ahead of him.""He says he's innocent, and I think you have to remember that. He said very strongly yesterday that he's innocent. So you'll have to talk to him about that. But we absolutely wish him well," Trump said.The White House initially defended Porter after both of his ex-wives came forward with allegations of physical and emotional abuse.Officials shifted their tone after Porter’s resignation, however, with chief of staff John Kelly saying “there is no place for domestic violence in our society," but that he stood by his "previous comments of the Rob Porter that I have come to know since becoming chief of staff."
