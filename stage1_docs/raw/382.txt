The visitors were looking to make it beyond the last 16 in the Champions League for just the second time and got off to a flyer when Ilkay Gundogan headed Kevin De Bruyne's corner on 14 minutes. 
Their advantage was doubled when Bernardo Silva's looping effort went in the net after good work  from Raheem Sterling.  
Sergio Aguero's long-range effort put City three up just before the break and Gundogan sealed the outstanding win with a curling strike early in the second-half. 
City's 4-0 victory has all but guaranteed their spot in the quarter-finals, despite the fact they face the Swiss side at the Etihad Stadium for the second leg in the tie. 
And Kompany suggested his side will carry on the high intensity even though they have a substantial lead. 
He said: "If we have this game at the Etihad and it's 3-2 or a 2-2 draw that won't give us a good feeling to go to the next round with.
"We've shown we're the better team today and only for a lack of motivation and effort could we not be that team again when we play at the Etihad."
