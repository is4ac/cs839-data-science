Liam Brady has admitted the club ‘made a mistake’ by judging the striker too quickly, having watched Kane become one of the most clinical strikers in world football.
After leaving Arsenal, and after a brief trial with Watford, Kane moved to rivals Tottenham aged 11 and has since gone on to score 101 Premier League goals by the age of 24, including seven goals in seven games against Spurs’ fiercest foes.
Kane recently admitted being released by the Gunners, the club he supported as a boy, was ‘the best thing that ever happened’ to him.

And, after seeing him score the winner in Saturday’s north London derby, ex-academy chief Brady admits the club were wrong to let him go.
“He was a bit chubby,” he told Italian publication Corriere della Sera.
“He wasn’t very athletic, but we made a mistake.
“Tottenham sent him out on loan to lower-division clubs three or four times as well.
“But through his determination he has carved out an amazing career and he deserves it.
“He has a character that drives him to improve all the time."
