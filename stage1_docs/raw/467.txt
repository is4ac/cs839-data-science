Full credit to Derry
Within moments of Cambridge’s 0-0 draw with Lincoln on Friday night, the club tweeted the announcement that Shaun Derry had left his position as manager. The 40-year-old was appointed in November 2015 and, amazingly, Cambridge director Graham Daniels said the decision to part ways had been made with Derry prior to the Lincoln game. "We sat down in the last few days and said 'what's best for you going ahead, what's best for us?'" he told Radio Cambridgeshire. However, Dan was still baffled by the whole affair. “Credit to Shaun Derry," he told talkSPORT.com in reference to him taking charge of the team knowing it would be his last as manager. "I don’t see them getting a better manager,” he added.
The hard work starts now for Heckingbottom
Paul Heckingbottom’s first game in charge of Leeds ended in a 2-1 defeat to Sheffield United. “The hard work begins now,” Dan explained. “Leeds were second best [against Sheffield United] for long periods and if he thought he could sneak into a play-off place... they can’t and if that is the expectation from above, then we’ve got an interesting few months ahead. They’re nowhere near it.”

Aston Villa to go up automatically?
“They’ve got serious momentum,” Dan said following the club’s 2-0 derby win against Birmingham. It was their seventh straight league win and puts them in second place in the Championship. “The players are taking risks and playing on the front foot, and fans are right behind them. Wolves have won [the league], but after them, you’d have to put your money on Villa for second place. [Manager] Steve Bruce is getting the best out of them and full credit to him because he was on compassionate leave this week and his presence was a big boost for his players.”
