It feels like we’re about to be at a tipping point, Academy Award speculation wise. The fall film festival season is almost upon us, which will start to separate contenders from pretenders. Who and what that will be remains to be seen, though we mostly know the players that will appearing at upcoming fests. With the impending chaos, I might be doing a second update to predictions at the end of the month, but that’s up in the air right now. Today is an update though, of course. It’s presented without any real commentary, as whatever I write will be out of date pretty quickly. For now, just enjoy them and speculate on what changes will be coming in the next few weeks. Take a gander…
Again, there isn’t a whole lot new to say right now, but when you look at these predictions, just try to think like a potential Academy member. Do they seem likely and logical to you? The membership is slowly changing, but does that mean they’ll be accepting of something like Blade Runner 2046, mother!, or Star Wars: The Last Jedi? Are we looking at traditional biopics like Battle of the Sexes or Darkest Hour or even a musical biopic in The Greatest Showman as the likely dominators? Time will tell. For the moment, we’re just waiting for some festivals to upend the season.
Here now is my latest set of Oscar predictions:
