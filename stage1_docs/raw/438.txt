The midfielder is not a first-team regular at the Spanish champions and has started just one league game all season.
It has led to reports growing that the 23-year-old will consider his options in the summer and hear out any offers made for him.
And, according to AS, Kovacic won't be short of suitors as Inter Milan, Tottenham and Roma are all chasing him.
The trio are tracking the Croatian ahead of the summer transfer window and are ready to pounce if he comes on the market.
Roma are reportedly at the front of the queue at the moment and their director of football, Monchi, is organising talks with Real Madrid.
