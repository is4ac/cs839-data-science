Spurs will travel to Turin this week to face Juventus in the first leg of their last 16 clash.
The Premier League side may receive a boost ahead of Tuesday's game, with the possibility that Dybala may not feature as he faces a late fitness test.
The 24-year-old striker has been in great form for the Italian champions – he scored 19 goals last season and has netted 17 times already this term.
And despite the threat he will pose to Spurs’ hopes of progression, Pochettino hopes his fellow Argentine will be fit to play.
“I think Dybala will recover and I hope he does, because I think it’s always nice to play against the best in the world,” Pochettino said in an interview with Rai Sport.
“I put Dybala in that category, because he is a special talent and seeing him on the pitch is wonderful, even if he might cause your team a few problems.”
Dybala has missed five games with a thigh injury, but another Tottenham man who is hoping he will be fit in time is former Juventus striker Fernando Llorente.
“We expect him to play,” he told Tuttosport. “We always read he could return against us.
“I only managed to spend pre-season training with Paulo, but it was enough to know he has the kind of ability that really catches the eye.”
“We expect him to play. We always read he could return against us, but with Paulo or without, Juve remain a superpower. Just think of Gonzalo Higuain, Mario Mandzukic, Douglas Costa…”
Meanwhile, Spurs are facing their own injury problems with defender Toby Alderweireld set to be left at home for the game.
The Belgian centre-back made his comeback from three months out with injury by playing 90 minutes in Spurs’ FA Cup win over Newport County last week.
But he was not risked for Saturday’s win over north London derby rivals Arsenal, and it is claimed he will not travel for the trip to Italy as he continues to work on his fitness in London.
