Last night, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association again defied expectations with their Golden Globe selections. As always, the HFPA do their own thing, the Academy be damned. Now, that’s a bit different this year, as voters for the Academy Awards were potentially watching, with voting currently going on. In that sense, this show actually might have impacted potential nominees, though future winners are a whole other thing. It made for an unpredictable ceremony, which more than lived up to that expectation. You’ll be able to see the full list of Golden Globe winners below, but first…a tiny bit of analysis and discussion.
The Globes spread the love, though leading the charge was Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri with four wins (including Best Picture – Drama, Best Screenplay, and two acting prizes) one of only three films to take home multiple statues. The other movies were Lady Bird (which won for Best Picture – Comedy or Musical as well as Best Actress in a Comedy or Musical for Saoirse Ronan) and The Shape of Water (Best Director for Guillermo del Toro and Best Score), both of which won a pair. The only other flicks with wins yesterday were Coco, Darkest Hour, The Disaster Artist (which produced the best moment of the telecast, when James Franco won Best Actor in a Comedy or Musical and ended up with Tommy Wiseau joining him on stage), The Greatest Showman, I, Tonya, and In the Fade. They all had singular wins. Now, we wait to see if Oscar was paying attention at all…
