In just under a month, the Oscars will be handed out. Voting has not yet opened up for Academy members, so we remain in a form of awards season stasis. The calm before the final storm, if you will. There’s not a whole lot of news to sift through here, beyond the Directors Guild result. The Writers Guild will be our next clue, but until then, we’re in neutral. So, despite me saying one thing, I’m doing another. I may tell you to stick for now with the predictions you already have, at least until voting begins, but for the sake of readership, I’ve tinkered a bit with my predictions here. There’s not a whole lot of change, but there’s some mild experimentation going on, so there’s that. After all, this is kind of what I specialize in.
There’s not a whole lot to be figured out, but a few categories do still seem to be up for grabs. By and large, it looks like it could be a good night for The Shape of Water, with Guillermo del Toro a lock to win Best Director and Best Picture seemingly gravitating towards the film itself. Other movies still in play obviously include Get Out and Lady Bird as spoilers, while depending on who you ask, Dunkirk and especially Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri are right there as well. The acting categories seem pretty clearly to favor the current frontrunners too, so really the only major category where there could be some real suspense right now is Best Original Screenplay. There, you could make the case for any of the five. Stay tuned…
