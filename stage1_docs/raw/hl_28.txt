Well, it just happened. The nominations were announced moments ago for the 90th annual Academy Awards. We had some snubs, some surprises, and now we finally know the actual Oscar field. This is the end of Phase One, with Phase Two and a campaign for actual wins about to begin. By and large, the main contenders held steady, with The Shape of Water seemingly moving into the pole position overall. Get Out, Lady Bird, and Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri remain in play as well, though each suffered notable misses this morning. That’s the name of the game though, so this year is no different.
As you can see, The Shape of Water led the field with 13 nominations. Next in line were Dunkirk at eight citations and Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri at seven. Notably, we saw snubs with The Big Sick, The Florida Project, and I, Tonya missing in Best Picture, Martin McDonagh missing in Best Director for Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, James Franco missing in Best Actor for The Disaster Artist, and Holly Hunter missing in Best Supporting Actress for The Big Sick. On the flip side, Phantom Thread was the surprise of the morning, getting into unexpected categories like Best Picture, Best Director for Paul Thomas Anderson, and Best Supporting Actress for Leslie Manville. More commentary to come, but for now, on to the nominees…
