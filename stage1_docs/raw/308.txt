McLeish met the Scottish Football Association board on Wednesday night and a contract that runs until 2020 has now been agreed.
The former Rangers, Birmingham and Aston Villa manager's second spell in charge of the national team will officially be confirmed on Friday morning.
McLeish's first spell in the job saw him oversee 10 games in charge.
He marked his debut as manager with a 2-1 win away in Georgia and he would go on to win seven of his total matches.
The most memorable of them was a 1-0 win over France in Paris, given to them by James McFadden's goal.
Italy pipped them to qualification for Euro 2008 and McLeish later resigned to take over at Birmingham.
