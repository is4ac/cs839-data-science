This happened to Mark Clattenburg, one of the most distinguished referees in the game, when a stray bottle hit him in the face. 
He has officiated in the Premier League but now plies his trade in the gulf state of Saudi Arabia and Al-Ettifaq left-back Hussein Sayed inadvertently lobbed a bottle at the man in the middle. 
Clattenburg seemed quite shock in the immediate aftermath before Sayed swiftly apologised to him. 
And Clattenburg was a good sport when he jokingly gave the player a yellow card. Watch the incident below...
