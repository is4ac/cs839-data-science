This coming weekend, the British Academy will hand out their honors. BAFTA represents really the last time for Oscar hopefuls to change the game before voting begins. It’s distinctly possible that many sets of voter eyes will be on BAFTA to see what its membership does. The Academy won’t necessarily follow along, but they might. Last year, La La Land won and of course we all know that Moonlight pulled the Oscar upset, so anything is possible. Still, this is our final clue, so it’s worthwhile to pay close attention. After this, nothing else will really have an impact, so voters will make their final choices not long after. Ignore it at your own peril.
This feels like a battle between Darkest Hour, Dunkirk, The Shape of Water, and Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. Obviously, that will happen in Best Film, where they’re competing with Call Me By Your Name, and the winner could see a surge towards the Academy Award. Best Picture could mirror this, though that’s no foregone conclusion. In short, if Dunkirk, The Shape of Water, and Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri take the big BAFTA prize, they could end up the frontrunner for the Oscar. Other than that, it could be a real good show overall for Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. If not, we may have to discount these results and just assume the Academy is going to side with The Shape of Water. We shall see…
