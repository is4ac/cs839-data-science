Ted Lieu (D-Calif.) blasted President Trump   ’s decision to block the release of the House Intelligence Committee Democrats’ memo, accusing him of intentionally misleading the public and saying that “an innocent person would not block the memo.”The White House announced Friday that Trump "is inclined to declassify" the document but cited national security concerns for not doing so yet. The document aims to rebut a GOP surveillance memo alleging anti-Trump bias in the FBI and Justice Department,  “THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS,” Lieu tweeted of the decision. “Both GOP & Dems voted to release Dem memo. I read it and am convinced [Donald Trump] is now intentionally hiding relevant information from the American people in order to mislead the public. An innocent person would not block the memo.”THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS. Both GOP & Dems voted to release Dem memo. I read it and am convinced @realDonaldTrump is now intentionally hiding relevant information from the American people in order to mislead the public. An innocent person would not block the memo.#ReleaseTheDemMemo https://t.co/f2bCtid8DQ— Ted Lieu (@tedlieu) February 9, 2018ADVERTISEMENT

Lieu joins a chorus of Democrats questioning Trump’s refusal to release the memo. Democratic leaders Rep. Nancy Pelosi    (Calif.) and Sen. Charles Schumer    (N.Y.) both claimed that Trump has “something to hide” by choosing not to release the memo.Trump approved the declassification of the original GOP memo, and said that it “totally vindicates” him in the Russia probe. The GOP memo accused FBI and Justice Department officials of abusing a surveillance program to unfairly target the Trump campaign.Some GOP lawmakers have also called for the release of the Democratic memo, saying that Americans have the right to read both documents. The House Intelligence Committee voted unanimously earlier this week to release the Democratic document.
