The Reds have not competed in the knockout stages of this competition since 2009, where Chelsea unceremoniously dumped them out.
Jurgen Klopp’s men were one of only four sides to remain unbeaten in the group stages of this season’s competition, scoring 23 goals in the process – a record for an English side.
However, they face a Porto side looking to progress to the quarter-finals for the first time since 2004 when they won the competition under Jose Mourinho.
The Dragao stadium produced 15 goals during the group stages, the second highest this season.
The signs point towards a goal-fest, so tune in to the action live via the link above.
