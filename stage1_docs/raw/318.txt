Boeung Ket were thrashed 9-0 by Ceres Negros in the AFC Cup, andÂ Sovanrithy was not only part of the defence that conceded nine goals - he conspired to score one of them!
Sovanrithy thundered a header past his own keeper, and proceeded to fall onto his knees in despair.
You can watch a video of the goal above...
