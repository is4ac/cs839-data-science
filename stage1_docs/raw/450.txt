Jose Mourinho's wait for his first Premier League win at St James' Park continued on Sunday as old foe Rafael Benitez oversaw a memorable 1-0 victory.
Matt Ritchie's strike proved the difference on an afternoon when relegation-threatened Newcastle dug deep, stuck together and gave their all - a performance that second-placed Red Devils were no match for.
PLAYER RATINGS - Newcastle 1-0 Man United: Jose Mourinho's flops rated and slated
"Poor," Jones said of his side's display. "Poor. We started slow and sloppy. The crowd were on their feet, they got momentum.
"We gained a bit of momentum midway through the first half. Second half we had a few chances, cleared off the line but, you know, we're not kidding ourselves. We were not good enough today."
Jones conceded it "wasn't about luck" in Sunday's defeat given Mourinho's side put in a meek, undercooked display that they can ill-afford to repeat.
"We started too slow and couldn't get to the rhythm of our game," the England international told MUTV.
"For whatever reason, we weren't good enough today and we'll have to play a lot better than that if we're going to kick on and improve.
"You know, they didn't (create a lot of chances) even when the crowd were on their feet and had a few half chances, (even though) the crowd think it's sort of a one-on-one.
"We had a few chances ourselves, could have scored, but I think the result was probably fair. I don't think we deserved to win the game today.
"It was a disappointing day, but we have to go again. That's all we can do, that's all we know. We're disappointed, we're devastated, but we have to improve."
