When New York Times critic Wesley Morris launched a pointed argument about awards-season villain Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, a surprising figure was lurking the comments section. “I loved this movie, and intend to see it again,” the commenter wrote. “My son, Sam, won a Golden Globe for playing Jason Dixon. I think I would still love the movie if another actor had played Dixon … But not quite as much.” What? On Jimmy Kimmel Live! Sam Rockwell confirmed the commenter was indeed his dad, Pete Rockwell. Good lookin’ out.
