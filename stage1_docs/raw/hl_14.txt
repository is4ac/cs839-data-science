Over the weekend, a pair of screenplay precursors were announced, bringing us very close to the end of the season. On Saturday night, the USC Scripter awards were handed out, while last night saw the Writers Guild of America hold their ceremony. With only BAFTA still to chime in, among the truly influential precursors, the race is still in flux overall, though with more and more categories starting to come into focus. Post BAFTA, that’ll be the time to really analyze where we are, but for now, WGA and the USC Scripter at least wrapped up Best Adapted Screenplay at the Academy Awards.
The Writers Guild opted to continue the steady stream of wins for James Ivory and Call Me By Your Name. The USC Scripter prize went to Ivory as well, so he seems set for Oscar. In the WGA Original category, we saw Jordan Peele take it for Get Out, perhaps pushing that film a bit towards the top of the Academy Award category as well. Not having Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri eligible with the WGA prevented a full head on collision, but seeing Lady Bird and The Shape of Water lose definitely gives them a black mark. In all likelihood, the Oscar in Original Screenplay is between Get Out and Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. Anyway, take a look at this weekend’s results and sit tight for much more on what it all means in the days and weeks to come…
