The 21-year-old has been in red-hot form this season netting 14 goals in 28 appearances in all competitions.
His performances have attracted interest from Europe's biggest names, with reportedly up to nine clubs keeping close tabs on his situation at Leipzig.
Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United, Manchester City, Tottenham and Arsenal are all rumoured to be interested in snapping him up, while Real Madrid, Barcelona and Atletico Madrid have also declared their interest in the young forward.
Leipzig have denied reports that Werner is eyeing a summer move but, according to Tuttosport, their cause hasn't been helped by the 21-year-old's decision to reject a contract extension.
Werner is said to be aware of the growing interest and is thought to be considering his options before making a final decision.
The in-form striker is set to be part of the Germany squad who will travel to Russia for this summer's World Cup.
