Jurgen Klopp’s Redmen all-but booked their place in the quarter-finals on Wednesday night with a sensational 5-0 away victory over Porto.
Their lethal front-three ran riot in Portugal, as Sadio Mane scored his first Liverpool hat-trick, Mohamed Salah plundered his 30th goal of the season and Roberto Firmino joined in the fun by also netting in the massive win.

Despite their breath-taking display, there are doubts the Reds can go all the way due to their shaky defence.
And while Barnes insists he is not getting carried away, he believes their lightning counter-attacking style means they will be a threat to any of the European elite.
Speaking on the Alan Brazil Sports Breakfast, the ex-Liverpool star said: “Obviously they could win it, but when you come into the latter stages and you have teams like Man City, Barcelona, Bayern Munich, Real Madrid and PSG, we can’t get carried away.
“But I actually fancy them playing against teams like that, who play an open and attacking game, which would allow them to counter-attack.
“Liverpool are the best counter-attacking team in the country, and probably in Europe.
“Man City pass the ball through you, but in terms of sheer pace, aggression and counter-attacking, Liverpool are the best in Europe at that.”
