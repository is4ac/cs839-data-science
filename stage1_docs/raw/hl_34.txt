Seven days from now, we’ll know who and what the Academy Award nominees are. My final set of predictions will drop on Monday, but for now, I wanted to tinker just a little bit first. For what it’s worth, over the coming weekend, the Producers Guild of America and the Screen Actors Guild will be giving out their awards, so while that can’t impact nominations, it’s still noteworthy. They’re arguably the two biggest precursors, and gems of the guild season, so there’s a chance that I might tinker with final predictions next week if something crazy goes on there. That’s a problem for future me though.
As you’ll see below, not a whole lot has changed. Ballots are in though, so what’s done is done. I’m working my few Oscar voter sources to see if anything has gotten more love than expected. If you saw yesterday’s article, things are poised to end up with The Shape of Water leading the nominations. That’s pretty much a foregone conclusion. After that, the best days will probably be had by either Dunkirk or Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. In a few days I’ll be looking at potential shut outs, so watch out for that, but you can see next which films are locked out from the big show. Anyway, on to the main event…
