The Gunners are currently tracking the 21-year-old ahead of the summer transfer window.
Arsenal scouts have been watching the Serbian in action and they were in attendance once again at the weekend as Benfica beat Portimonense 3-1.
Zivkovic bagged the third goal during the victory as he put in another eye-catching performance.
And, according to Sapo Desporto, Arsenal scouts are now urging Wenger to swoop for the winger, who has starred in a central role in recent weeks,Â in the summer.
Gunners staff who have watched Zivkovic are said to have returned with glowing reports and they believe he would thrive in England.
Manchester United have also been linked with the Serbia international in the past, while clubs in Germany have scouted him too.
