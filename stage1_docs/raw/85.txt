In a new video for W Magazine, Lindsay Lohan revisits eight of the most iconic lines from her modern high-school classic Mean Girls. While Tina Fey’s screenplay may or may not be improved upon (Is Costco funnier than Sears now? Dillard’s? What about Kohl’s?), the familiarity of each line suggests that maybe it’s time to pick eight new lines to love and constantly recite from the movie. Let 2018 be the year we all call each other half a virgin, stab Caesar, and point out we’re a mouse, duh.
