The Argentina international has just returned to the fold at Spurs after being out injured for over a year.
The 25-year-old is beginning to establish himself again under Mauricio Pochettino since his comeback and his performances have caught Interâ€™s eye.
The San Siro club would love to sign Lamela this summer and, according to Calciomercato, he is open to the move.
The winger enjoyed his time in Italy before with Roma and he is happy to return to Serie A in the future.
Spurs, however, have not given any indication that they would be willing to let Lamela leave.
