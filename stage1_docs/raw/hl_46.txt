Folks, welcome to 2018! First of all, a very sincere Happy New Year to you all out there. Hopefully you had a fun and safe sendoff to 2017. A whole new year is upon us now, and as such, there’s a ton of new films to anticipate. Fun, right? Today will be a day to look forward, which is no particularly uncommon in early January. Indeed, there’s a whole slate of titles emerging in the weeks and months to come, so that’s what we’ll be focusing on. Even just in the coming days, we’ll see 2018 releases begin to overtake 2017 expansions. There will be some rather rough times as studios dump their lesser projects, but look to the independent flicks for saving graces until the bigger films begin to come out, many of which are on the list I present to you today!
Below you will see a fairly heaping dose of 2018 releases that are well worth keeping an eye out for. There’s a bunch of indies, a ton of blockbusters, and plenty in between. There’s some Oscar hopefuls like First Man, The Frontrunner, The Irishman, and Wildlife, as well as another Star Wars outing. It’s looking like a decent enough year, though there’s no way to know just yet. As you go down the list, you’ll see a real wide variety of things. It’s not an exhaustive list, obviously, and it’s no more than the 100 I put out last year, but I did the best that I could. Give it a close look and enjoy:

Basically, much like we had last year, this is just one big guess at the moment. There’s no real way to tell what smaller films will break through, especially with many of them still in the process of filming right now. This time last year, no one was really thinking about Lady Bird, for example. Contenders like that will emerge throughout the year. First up will be the Sundance Film Festival later on this month, where plenty of indie contenders will emerge. Last year, The Big Sick first popped up there, for example. Then, it’ll be on to the rest of the year. Sit back and try to enjoy 2018. Above are 100 examples of things that might tickle your fancy. It should be an interesting year, at the very least…
Stay tuned to see how 2018 goes for all of these titles!
