Ronaldo is the current Ballon D’Or holder after helping Madrid retain the Champions League last season for the first time in the competition’s history.
Meanwhile, Neymar is hoping to prise the crown from his hands and justify his tag as the world’s most expensive player by helping the Parisians to Champions League glory.
Although Zinedine Zidane probably fears for his job after slipping 17 points behind Barcelona in LaLiga, the Frenchman has won 10 out of 14 knockout games as Real boss.
Their Ligue 1 adversaries however have lost four out of their last six away Champions league knockout games away from home.
