We’re heading towards the end of the line, ladies and gentlemen. Well into November now, we’ve only got a few films left to see before all of the contenders will be known entities. As such, it’s a perfect time for an Academy Award predictions update. This is also the time of the year where multiple updates in a month seems appropriate, and in fact, necessary. The race is constantly evolving, which makes any prediction made a month ago completely obsolete. We’re not quite at the weekly point in the year yet, but that’s not too far off, frankly. Before you know it, the big morning will be upon us, and then it’ll be on to Phase Two.
Some things reflected here include Steve Carell going Supporting for Battle of the Sexes, as well as Chappaquidick being pushed to 2018. There’s also the fallout of Kevin Spacey being recast with Christopher Plummer in All the Money in the World. Plummer isn’t included right now since that’s just such an X factor at the moment, but keep an eye on him if his work is completed in time and the film still hits theaters in December. Other than that, there’s movies and performances constantly juggling for space at the top of each category. Read on and you can see who and what I have getting nominated at the moment…
