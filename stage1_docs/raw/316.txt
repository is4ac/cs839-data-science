The midfielder moved to the Nou Camp in 2016 from Valencia and big things were expected of him.
However the Portugal international has failed to sparkle for Barca and has been linked with a move away for the best part of a year.
Tottenham tried to strike a loan deal for Gomes last summer, while West Ham made an enquiry in January.
And now both clubs will be on red alert as, according to AS, Barcelona are finally ready to sell the 34-year-old this summer.
The Spanish giants are reportedly ready to cash in on Gomes so they can use the funds to bolster other areas of the squad.
