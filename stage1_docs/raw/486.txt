After City thrashed Leicester 5-1 on Saturday night, Pep Guardiola’s men are now on 72 points after 27 games at the top of the table.
The result leaves them 16 points clear of United, who lost to Newcastle United on Sunday at St James' Park.
Defeat to the Magpies now means that if City win all of their next five in the Premier League, Jose Mourinho’s men will be forced to give the Citizens a guard of honour at the Etihad when the two sides meet on April 7.
But it gets worse still for United.
If City win all of their next five games, defeat for United on derby day will more than likely mean their neighbours are crowned Premier League champions there and then.
It’s a lose-lose situation for the Red Devils and just highlights how superior Pep Guardiola’s men have been over their Premier League rivals this season.
Given the fact City have lost just one game all season, it seems the title could be wrapped up by April and right under their noses of their closest rivals.
But they wouldn’t have it any other way though would they?
