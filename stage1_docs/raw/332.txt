Liverpool have one foot in the quarter-finals after they beat Porto 5-0 in a breath-taking attacking display on Wednesday night.
PLAYER RATINGS: Jurgen Klopp's men rated and slated after five-star victory over Porto
Their star trio of Sadio Mane, Mohamed Salah and Roberto Firmino ran riot in Portugal, with Mane’s hat-trick, Salah’s 30th goal of the season and another strike from the Brazilian leading Liverpool to a stunning win - which equalled the record for the biggest away victory in Champions League history.
Their back-four still may be questioned, and Porto did have their chances to score, but Saunders believes Klopp’s men ‘can beat anyone’ in their current form and can challenge for their sixth European Cup this term.
Speaking on the Alan Brazil Sports Breakfast, the former Reds star said: “Can they win the Champions League? Yes – with that front three playing the way they are at the moment.
“I think they could beat anyone.
“Whether they can resist against the top, top teams at the back, that remains to be seen because that’s not quite right yet.
“But if you attack Liverpool, you do it at your peril at the moment, because if you leave that front three with any space, they’re linking up perfectly.”

After mauling Porto 5-0 last night, can Liverpool now go on and win the Champions League?
Dean Saunders says they definitely can... #LFC
