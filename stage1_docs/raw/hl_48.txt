Before the we turn the page from 2017 to 2018, of course there needs to be a new set of Oscar predictions, right? These are the final days of the year (look for a best of 2017 post tomorrow), with every film in contention having been screened for critics and voting bodies, if not in wide release for audiences. That lets the box office begin to become a small factor. Not a huge one, mind you, as otherwise Beauty and the Beast or Star Wars: The Last Jedi would be Best Picture frontrunners. However, it lets you see how Lady Bird has connected with audiences, for example. It all just goes into the mix when doing analysis.
As you’ll see below, not much has changed, as this is the calm period in the season. Precursors will start up again in earnest soon, but until then, we’re in a bit of a holding pattern. I remain of the mindset that Lady Bird is the current Best Picture frontrunner, while aside from Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor, most races are wide open. Even then, while Gary Oldman seems still likely in Actor, Willem Dafoe is hardly unbeatable in Supporting Actor. Best Director could go any number of ways, while Actress and Supporting Actress are super competitive. You’ll see what I mean next, but just keep that all in mind, especially considering the lack of movement in many categories…
