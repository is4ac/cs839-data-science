After gaining just 13 points from their opening 20 games, the Swans have won four of their last seven under Carvalhal and look likely to complete an unlikely escape.
The former Sheffield Wednesday boss has earned a reputation for conjuring unlikely results as well as obscure metaphors and produced both on Saturday afternoon at the Liberty Stadium.
Carvalhal said: "When we arrived we were in the deep ocean. It was very deep and dark.
“We saw no fishes.
“We won some games, to put our noses out of the water. It was the first time we'd smelled the fresh air.
"Now, in this moment, we have started swimming and we can now go to the coast.
“But we must continue to swim to reach the coastline.”
Carvalhal has developed a habit of using metaphors when it comes to talking about Swansea, after comparing their transfer business to shopping for 'sardines not lobsters' last month.
Victory over the Clarets moved Swansea up to 15th in the table and two points clear of the relegation places.
After a tricky FA Cup fifth round tie at former club Sheffield Wednesday, Carvalhal will take his troops to the Amex Stadium for a huge clash against fellow strugglers Brighton.
