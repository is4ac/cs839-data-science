The American people deserve the whole story," Grassley said in a statement. "That includes whether there was improper influence from any side, in any investigation, surrounding the 2016 election. My Democratic colleagues, unfortunately, seem to be only interested in one point of view, but I hold out hope they will support me in these efforts.”The Trump Tower meeting has become a crucial focus of the wide-ranging investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election, with Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller  and committees in the House and Senate looking into whether the Trump campaign was involved in the efforts.
