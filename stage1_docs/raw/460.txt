The Blues, reigning Premier League champions, are sixth in the league ahead of their game against West Brom on Monday night and Conte is cracking the whip in training to halt the poor run of form.
“I think that usually when you work you don’t smile," he said. “Especially if you work hard. It’s very difficult to smile.
“Only through work can you reach a fantastic target like last season. Last season, our work allowed us to reach an incredible target," he said in reference to the title triumph.
Here, though, are some worrying stats for fans.
THREE DEFEATS
Chelsea could lose a third consecutive competitive game in a single season for the first time since the 2002/03 season - pre-Roman Abramovich era - when Claudio Ranieri was in charge. The Blues were actually winless in four games if you count the 0-0 draw with Fulham on 23 September.
The losses
28/09/02: Chelsea 2-3 West Ham (Premier League)
03/10/02: Viking 4-2 Chelsea (UEFA Cup)
06/10/02: Liverpool 1-0 Chelsea (Premier League)

NOT A GOOD START TO THE YEAR
Antonio Conte’s Chelsea team have won just three of their 10 matches in 2018 – drawing four and losing three games.
BLUES TO EQUAL UNWANTED RECORD?
Chelsea could also equal their top flight record of failing to score in three home games in a row, which they last did in 1993.
